# About Swedish Subsidiarity

**Swedish Subsidiarity** (Svensk Subsidiaritet) is an independent research and policy initiative dedicated to analyzing and resolving the systemic fragility caused by over-centralization in modern society.

We are not a political party. We are systems architects.

## Our Mission

Sweden is facing a paradox. We have built the world's most sophisticated centralized systems, but these very systems are now generating fragility rather than security.

Our mission is to:
1.  **Diagnose** the structural failures in critical systems (food, healthcare, energy, etc.).
2.  **Design** concrete protocols for distributed governance (Subsidiarity).
3.  **Build** the digital infrastructure required to make subsidiarity practically viable in the 21st century.

## The Origin

The initiative was founded in 2026 by **Björn Kenneth Holmström** in response to the widening gap between citizens and power. What began as an analysis of 50 global existential risks distilled down to a single core insight:

> *"You cannot solve complex problems with central command. You must distribute the intelligence."*

This was also the background of the development of the **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)** and its specific application for Sweden: **GGF-SE**.

## The Technology: GGF-OS

We do not believe policy alone can change society. We need code.
That is why we are developing **GGF-OS** – an operating system for bioregional self-governance built on distributed technology (Holochain). This enables neighborhoods and municipalities to coordinate without waiting for permission from the capital.

## Be Part of the Solution

We are not looking for passive members. We are looking for capacity.

* **Are you a developer?** Help us build the code (Rust/Svelte).
* **Are you a farmer?** Help us design food guilds.
* **Are you a healthcare worker?** Help us draft care protocols.
