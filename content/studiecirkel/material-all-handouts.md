# HANDOUT - SUMMARIES FOR PARTICIPANTS

---

## MEETING 1: THE SWEDISH PARADOX

### What we learned:

**Centralization** = Decisions are made far away from you

* Example: The Transport Administration in Borlänge decides about your village bus.

**Monoculture** = The same solution everywhere

* Efficient but vulnerable.
* Like when all potatoes are the same variety and a disease wipes out the whole crop.

**System Architecture** = How power is *built*, not who holds it

* The problem is not people but the structure.

### Next time:

We learn "The Proximity Compass"—a tool to diagnose where power and knowledge sit.

### Your homework (optional):

Write down a local resource that "the system" doesn't see:

* A person's skill
* A place
* A knowledge

## MEETING 2: THE PROXIMITY COMPASS

### The three corners:

**1. POWER:** From where are decisions made?

* Central (Stockholm/EU/Region) or Local (here)?

**2. KNOWLEDGE:** Whose expertise counts?

* Formal (certificate, education) or Local (experience, context)?

**3. RESILIENCE:** How vulnerable is the system?

* One solution (vulnerable) or Multiple alternatives (robust)?

### How to use the compass:

1. Choose a system (school food, bus, healthcare, etc.).
2. Ask for each corner: Where are we on the scale?
3. Draw the triangle.
4. Interpret the shape:
* Pointy upwards = Centralized.
* Wide downwards = Local.



### Next time:

We learn *subsidiarity*—how to move power closer to people.

## MEETING 3: SUBSIDIARITY

### What is subsidiarity?

"No power should lie higher up than necessary."
= **Närstyre (Proximity rule)**
= **What can be done locally, SHOULD be done locally.**

### Why this is better:

**1. LOCAL KNOWLEDGE**

* Those who live in a system know things that remote experts never learn.

**2. SPEED**

* Decisions on site are faster than waiting for a regional meeting.

**3. RESPONSIBILITY**

* When you see the effect of your decisions every day, you become more responsible.

### Five working examples:

1. **Food Guilds** (Borlänge) - 50 households buy directly from the farmer.
2. **Neighborhood House** (Vivalla) - share tools instead of everyone owning them.
3. **Safety Rings** (Rinkeby) - neighbors who walk rounds.
4. **Energy Cooperative** (Gotland) - own solar electricity together.
5. **Cohousing** (Färdknäppen) - share life, not just the roof.

### Next time:

We choose ONE thing to actually do within 30 days. Bring ideas!

✓ Mapped our local assets (hands, places, hearts)
✓ Decided on ONE action to do within 30 days
✓ Split up responsibility (who does what, when)
✓ Signed a promise to each other

### Our action:

**It was built in rooms like these, by people like you."**
