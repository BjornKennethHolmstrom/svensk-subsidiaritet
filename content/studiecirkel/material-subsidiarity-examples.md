# SUBSIDIARITY EXAMPLES - Discussion Cards

---

## CARD 1: FOOD GUILDS (Borlänge, Sweden)

### What it is:

50 households join together and buy food directly from local farmers. Every week "food bags" are delivered to a central point. The members share the cost.

### How it works:

* **Organization:** 3-5 people handle procurement and logistics.
* **For the farmers:** Better pay (no middlemen).
* **For the consumers:** Save 20-30% compared to the grocery store (ICA).
* **Content:** Everything is seasonal and local.

### Subsidiarity Principle:

* **POWER:** With the members (they decide what is bought).
* **KNOWLEDGE:** The farmer knows what is in season, the members know what they need.
* **RESILIENCE:** If the grocery store closes, alternatives exist; several local farmers instead of a central warehouse.

### Discussion Questions:

1. Are there local farmers here you could contact?
2. Does anyone of you know someone who grows or produces food?
3. Would you be willing to eat more seasonally to get cheaper food?

## CARD 2: NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE (Vivalla, Örebro)

### What it is:

A neighborhood has a common "storage" where everyone can borrow tools, lawnmowers, toys, skis, etc. Instead of 50 families owning 50 drills, they own 3 together.

### How it works:

* **Premises:** The association rents a basement space.
* **Content:** Members contribute things they don't use often.
* **Booking:** Digital calendar or a list on the door.
* **Cost:** Annual fee approx. 500 SEK/family.

### Subsidiarity Principle:

* **POWER:** With the neighbors (they decide rules and what is allowed there).
* **KNOWLEDGE:** Someone who can fix stuff becomes "storage host".
* **RESILIENCE:** Less dependent on stores; can borrow from neighbors.

### Discussion Questions:

1. Is there an empty room or basement in your area?
2. What would you like to share instead of everyone owning it?
3. What things do you own that you use less than 10 times a year?

## CARD 3: SAFETY RINGS (Rinkeby, Stockholm)

### What it is:

80 neighbors in a block have a WhatsApp group and a rotating "safety shift". Different people walk a round at 21:00 every evening, making sure everything is okay, greeting people.

### How it works:

* **No weapons:** No power to arrest—only *presence*.
* **Reporting:** If something is wrong, they call the police.
* **Effect:** People feel safer because they see familiar faces.
* **Youths:** Feel seen (not chased).

### Subsidiarity Principle:

* **POWER:** With the neighborhood (they decide the schedule and rules).
* **KNOWLEDGE:** They recognize who lives there and who doesn't.
* **RESILIENCE:** If the police can't come, there are still neighbors who care.

### Discussion Questions:

1. Would you feel safer with more known faces out in the evening?
2. Would you walk a round once a month yourselves?
3. Are there places in your area where "more eyes" would help?

## CARD 4: ENERGY COOPERATIVE (Klinte, Gotland)

### What it is:

25 households joined together and bought solar panels together. They produce more electricity than they need and sell the surplus back to the grid.

### How it works:

* **Group purchase:** 40% discount on the panels.
* **Ownership:** The cooperative owns the facility jointly.
* **Profit:** Distributed or reinvested.
* **Backup:** With a battery, they can have electricity even if the grid goes down.

### Subsidiarity Principle:

* **POWER:** With the members (they decide how profit is used).
* **KNOWLEDGE:** Local technician installs and maintains.
* **RESILIENCE:** Not dependent on Vattenfall (major utility); own production.

### Discussion Questions:

1. Do you have roofs that could have solar panels?
2. Do you know anyone who knows installation or maintenance?
3. Would you be willing to invest 50,000 SEK together to save 20,000 SEK/year?

## CARD 5: COHOUSING (Färdknäppen, Stockholm)

### What it is:

50 apartments with a common dining room, laundry room, workshop, children's room. People eat together 3 times a week (voluntarily). Children play together. Elderly get company.

### How it works:

* **Private + Common:** Everyone has their own apartment but large common areas.
* **Cooking:** Rotates (everyone cooks for 50 people 2-3 times/year instead of cooking for 3 people 365 times/year).
* **Childcare:** Sharing responsibility—"it takes a village".
* **Elderly:** Don't become lonely—always people to talk to.

### Subsidiarity Principle:

* **POWER:** With the housing association (they decide rules).
* **KNOWLEDGE:** Those who live there know what is needed.
* **RESILIENCE:** Less vulnerable to loneliness, isolation, childcare crisis.

### Discussion Questions:

1. Would you like to eat dinner with neighbors a few times a week?
2. What would be difficult about sharing spaces?
3. Would it solve any of your everyday problems (loneliness, childcare, finances)?
