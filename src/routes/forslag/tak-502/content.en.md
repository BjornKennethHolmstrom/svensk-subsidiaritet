# National Strategy for Rural Resilience

## 1. Summary

This is not a proposal for new rural policy in the traditional sense. It is a **national resilience strategy**.

Sweden's current centralization has created a vulnerability where national security (food, energy, preparedness) rests on an increasingly thin population in the country's productive zones. We propose a shift from subsidies to investment through three mechanisms: **technology-neutral connectivity guarantee** (financed via total defense), **regional tax swap** (lowered tax on labor, increased on fixed assets), and **voluntary rural service** for young people.

The calculation shows that the reform can be **long-term budget-neutral or budget-positive** while securing skills supply throughout the country. The proposal requires coordination with the EU Commission regarding regionally differentiated support.

## 2. Situation Analysis: The Vulnerable Centralization

We see a structural extraction that threatens Sweden's functional capability:

* **The Cognitive Drainage:** "Brain drain" from rural to urban areas has created a dangerous skills shortage in the regions that produce our electricity, our forest, and our food.
* **Vulnerability in Crisis:** In a crisis or blockade, we lack the decentralized workforce required to maintain food and energy systems. The countryside is not a cost; it is our backup generator.
* **The Economic Paradox:** Value is created locally (wind power, mines) but profit is taxed centrally, leading resource-rich municipalities to go bankrupt.

## 3. The Solution: Three Systemic Mechanisms

To reverse the trend requires not charity, but changed incentives.

### Mechanism 1: Technology-Neutral Connectivity Guarantee (Total Defense)

Running fiber to every cottage is not socio-economically profitable. But having a population that can operate throughout the country is a security issue.

* **Decision:** The state guarantees 100/100 Mbit/s to every permanent residence and business in sparsely populated areas.
* **Technology:** Technology neutrality. Where fiber is too expensive, satellite (LEO) or directed 5G is used, lowering the cost by up to 90%.
* **Funding:** Re-budgeting from regional policy to **total defense**. Decentralized communication is critical infrastructure.

### Mechanism 2: Regional Tax Swap (Profitability and Justice)

We must make it cheaper to employ people where it is needed most, without costing the state money.

* **Lowered Employer Contributions:** Lowered by 10-15 percentage points in Zone 3 (support areas). This benefits small businesses, service, and care.
* **Increased Property Tax on Industrial Facilities:** Financed through a targeted increase in property tax on *non-movable* assets (wind turbines, hydropower, mines) in the same zone.
* **Effect:** Partial tax swap steering incentives from machines to people. Capital-intensive industry contributes more to the local infrastructure they utilize.
* **EU Approval:** Requires coordination with the EU Commission according to state aid rules. Finland has similar regional systems that can serve as precedent.

### Mechanism 3: Voluntary Rural Service (Skills Supply)

We replace passive labor market measures with active social responsibility.

* **Model:** A voluntary program for young people (19-25) offering 9-12 months of paid service focused on crisis preparedness, forest management, regenerative agriculture, and fire protection.
* **Incentive:** Participants receive a salary equivalent to a basic trained soldier, free housing, academic merit, and experience in shortage occupations. Can be linked to total defense training.
* **Value:** Gives young people an entry into shortage occupations in rural areas, strengthens civil defense, and performs necessary nature conservation that the market does not pay for.
* **Funding:** Partial redistribution of funds from the Public Employment Service as well as defense appropriations for civil-military cooperation.

## 4. State Financial Calculation (2028–2030)

Below is an estimated budget effect for the state at full implementation. The figures are preliminary and require deeper investigation.

| Item | Budget Effect (billion SEK/year) |
| --- | --- |
| Technology-neutral connectivity (operation and expansion) | +2.5 (cost) |
| Voluntary rural service (8,000 places/year) | +1.6 (cost) |
| Lowered employer contributions Zone 3 (10-15 percentage points) | +3.5 (cost) |
| Increased property tax on industrial facilities (Zone 3) | –2.8 (revenue, estimated) |
| Reduced labor market measures (partial transfer) | –1.2 (saving) |
| Long-term systemic effects (tax revenue, reduced emigration) | –2.0 to –4.0 (estimated, long-term effect) |
| **NET EFFECT STATE TREASURY (short-term)** | **+1.6 to +3.6 (net cost year 1-3)** |
| **NET EFFECT (long-term, 10+ years)** | **Potentially budget-neutral to positive** |

*Note: Property tax increase estimated based on total assessed value for industrial facilities in Zone 3. Long-term systemic effects include increased tax revenues from retained competence, reduced social costs, and stronger local economy. Detailed calculation requires cooperation with the Ministry of Finance.*

## 5. Conclusion

This proposal shows that it is possible to reverse rural depopulation through systemic incentive changes rather than passive subsidies. By taxing what is stationary (natural resource facilities) and facilitating mobile labor, we create conditions for competence to choose the whole country.

The reform requires initial investment but has the potential to be long-term budget-neutral or positive through stronger local economy, reduced urbanization, and improved crisis preparedness. Implementation presupposes coordination with the EU Commission and careful dialogue with affected industries.

We do not propose subsidies. We propose a **resilience premium**. In an uncertain world, a living countryside is not a matter of nostalgia — it is a matter of national survival and systemic robustness.

This basis is submitted as an open contribution to the political process, free to use and further develop.
