# Motion on Pilot Activity with Modernized Basic Security (Transition Guarantee)

## Proposal for Riksdag Decision

> **The Riksdag supports what is stated in the motion about appointing an inquiry to design and implement a limited national pilot activity with guaranteed basic security (Transition Guarantee), and announces this to the Government.**

## Reasoning

### Background: A Labor Market in Transformation

The Swedish labor market is undergoing a structural transformation of historical proportions. Automation, artificial intelligence, and the platform economy are changing the conditions for both entrepreneurship and employment at a pace that our existing security systems are not designed to handle.

Our current systems — unemployment insurance (A-kassa), activity support, and income support — are based on assumptions from 20th-century industrial society: stable employment, linear careers, and clear boundaries between work and non-work. This reality no longer exists for a growing share of the population.

### The Problem Picture: Three System Failures

#### 1. Administrative Trap (Benefit Trap)

Current systems require extensive administration and control to prevent abuse. This creates:

* High marginal costs for taking temporary or part-time employment (60-80% effective marginal tax rate when assistance is phased out)
* Extensive bureaucracy binding resources at both authorities and support seekers
* Uncertainty and stress complicating future planning and risk-taking

#### 2. Health Costs

Mental ill-health is Sweden's fastest-growing public health disease and primary cause of sick leave. The National Board of Health and Welfare's statistics show that economic insecurity is one of the main risk factors for anxiety and depression. Research from Karolinska Institutet (Strandh et al. 2023) documents that economic insecurity:

* Increases cortisol levels (stress hormone) by 40-60%
* Measurably impairs cognitive function (equivalent to 13 IQ points according to Mullainathan & Shafir 2013)
* Drives up societal costs by an estimated 70-90 billion SEK annually in healthcare, production loss, and administration

> **The Public Health Perspective:** Economic basic security is not a cost — it is preventive medicine. Every krona invested in reducing chronic economic stress saves an estimated 3-4 kronor in future healthcare costs and production loss.

#### 3. The Innovation Brake

Sweden ranks high in international innovation indices, but we have a paradox: few Swedes start companies compared to other OECD countries. The cause is not a lack of ideas or competence, but the structure of risk aversion.

Current security systems actively punish entrepreneurship:

* Anyone leaving employment to start a company loses A-kassa
* Anyone failing with a company lacks an economic soft landing
* The combination forces rational individuals to choose security over innovation

This stands in sharp contrast to countries with stronger basic security (Denmark, Netherlands) which have both higher entrepreneurship and higher innovation rates. Studies from OECD (2024) show that countries with more robust social safety nets have 30-40% higher business formation per capita.

### International Experiences

#### Finland (2017-2018)

Finland's basic income trial (560 €/month to 2,000 randomly selected unemployed) showed:

* No reduction in labor supply (contradicts the laziness hypothesis)
* Significantly improved mental health and perceived trust in the future
* Increased willingness to take temporary jobs and education
* Participants reported 15% lower stress levels (Kela 2020)

#### India and Kenya

Direct cash transfers in development economic contexts have shown: increased economic activity (multiplier effect 2.5x according to GiveDirectly), sharply improved health outcomes (especially for women and children), and reduced corruption by replacing discretionary grants with universal rights.

#### Alaska Permanent Fund

Alaska's oil dividend (1,000-2,000 USD/year since 1982) shows that universal payments do not reduce labor supply, sharply reduce poverty, and enjoy broad political support across party lines.

### Swedish Context: Why Now?

Sweden faces a unique window of opportunity to test basic security:

1. **Demographic Pressure:** With an aging population and declining dependency ratio, we must increase labor force participation and productivity. Basic security enables flexibility and transition.
2. **AI Transition:** McKinsey estimates that 30% of Swedish work tasks can be automated within 10 years. We need security systems that handle rapid transitions.
3. **Mental Ill-Health:** Sick leave for mental ill-health costs Sweden 70+ billion annually. Preventive interventions are economically rational.
4. **Gender Equality:** Basic security enables equitable distribution of care work without either party risking economic vulnerability.

### Relationship to A-kassa and the Swedish Model

A crucial misunderstanding must be dispelled: The Transition Guarantee does **not** replace income insurance — it complements it.

#### The Floor and the Staircase

The Swedish model is based on two functions:

* **Subsistence Minimum (The Floor):** No one should have to starve or become homeless
* **Income Loss Protection (The Staircase):** One should be able to maintain one's standard of living during unemployment

Today we try to solve both functions with the same tool (A-kassa/Income Support), which creates system failures. The Transition Guarantee separates these functions:

> **The Transition Guarantee = The Floor** (12,000 SEK/month subsistence minimum, state, universal)
> **A-kassa = The Staircase** (80% of previous salary up to ceiling, union negotiated, supplementary)

#### Strengthens, Not Weakens, the Swedish Model

This separation actually *benefits* the unions by:

* **Relieving administration:** A-kassa avoids handling "poverty administration" and can focus on its core function: income protection for members
* **Strengthening membership value:** With the Transition Guarantee as a floor, the difference between "non-member" (12,000 SEK) and "member" (12,000 + 80% of previous salary) becomes clearer than today
* **Enabling shorter transition times:** Members can take further education without economic disaster, increasing labor market mobility

> **Example of Interaction:**
> Person with previous salary 35,000 SEK/month becomes unemployed:
> **Without union membership:** 12,000 SEK/month (Transition Guarantee)
> **With union membership:** 12,000 SEK (Transition Guarantee) + 16,000 SEK (80% of 20,000 SEK surplus) = 28,000 SEK/month
> Union value: +16,000 SEK/month = 192,000 SEK/year. This is a *stronger* incentive for membership than today's system where the difference between A-kassa and Social Assistance is often only 3,000-5,000 SEK/month.

#### Guaranteed Supplementary Role

Proposed wording in the pilot activity's legislation:

> **§ Relation to other insurances:** The Transition Guarantee constitutes an economic floor and shall *not* reduce or replace compensation from unemployment insurance, sickness insurance, or other collective agreement-based insurances. Such compensations are paid in addition to the Transition Guarantee according to applicable rules and agreements.

### Qualification Conditions: A Citizen Contract

The Transition Guarantee is not a universal human right — it is a **contract between the Swedish state and its citizens and permanent residents**.

#### Eligibility for the Pilot Activity

* **Swedish citizenship**, regardless of residency time
* **Permanent Residence Permit (PUT)** AND at least **5 years of continuous tax history** in Sweden
* **Nordic citizenship** with at least 3 years of tax history in Sweden (Nordic Passport Union)

#### Design for Potential National Rollout

| Residency Time | Compensation Level | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-2 years (PUT holder) | 0 SEK | Establishment period, supported by existing systems |
| 3-5 years | 6,000 SEK/month (50%) | Partial guarantee during building of work experience |
| 5+ years or citizenship | 12,000 SEK/month (100%) | Full guarantee for established residents and citizens |

> **The Principle:** The Transition Guarantee is an insurance where the premium is paid through tax over time. Those who have recently come to Sweden have not yet paid in enough for full compensation. This is the same principle that applies to occupational pension and other earning rules.

#### Migration and Costs

The criticism that the Transition Guarantee would drive "welfare tourism" is based on misunderstandings about the system's construction: residence permit is still required, the 5-year requirement eliminates short-term migration, and 12,000 SEK/month is *lower* than Denmark's cash assistance (14,000 SEK) and Norway's social assistance (13,500 SEK).

### Design of the Pilot Activity

#### Scope and Duration

* **Duration:** 5 years (2028-2033)
* **Selection Method:** National stratified random sample (not geographically limited). 12,000 individuals are selected randomly from Sweden's population register. Stratification by gender, age, employment status, place of residence.
* **Control Group:** 12,000 individuals matched with the test group according to the same variables

> **Constitutional Basis:** Geographic trials violate the principle of equality in the Instrument of Government. National random selection is an established method for scientific studies (SCB, IFAU) where all citizens have equal probability of being selected. This is *research*, not special treatment.

#### Economic Model: The Work Line 2.0

The trial tests a **Negative Income Tax model** (NIT) combined with guaranteed floor. This system has **better work incentives than today's income support**.

| Income Level | Current System (Income Support) | Transition Guarantee | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 SEK/month | ~9,500 SEK | 12,000 SEK | +2,500 SEK (higher floor) |
| 5,000 SEK/month | ~9,500 SEK (lose all benefit) | 14,500 SEK (12,000 + 50% of 5,000) | +5,000 SEK (work pays) |
| 10,000 SEK/month | ~9,500-11,000 SEK | 17,000 SEK (12,000 + 50% of 10,000) | +6,000-7,500 SEK |
| 15,000 SEK/month | ~12,000-13,000 SEK | 19,500 SEK (12,000 + 50% of 15,000) | +6,500-7,500 SEK |
| **Marginal Tax** | **100%** (lose 1 SEK benefit per earned SEK) | **50%** (keep 50 öre per earned SEK) | **Better work incentives** |

> **The Work Line Restored:** Today's income support has 100% marginal tax — every earned krona reduces the benefit by one krona. The Transition Guarantee's 50% phase-out means that work always pays more than passivity.

#### The Gig Economy's Salvation

Today's system makes it *irrational* to take low-paid gig jobs. With income support and an Uber shift of 800 SEK, you lose 800 SEK in benefits — the net profit is zero. With Transition Guarantee, you earn 400 SEK net (keep 50%). This is the first real "work line for gig economy".

| Component | Design | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Guaranteed floor** | 12,000 SEK/month for adults, 6,000 SEK/month for children | Covers subsistence minimum according to Consumer Agency |
| **Phase-out** | 50% marginal deduction up to 30,000 SEK/month income | Ensures work always pays better than passivity |
| **Integration with tax** | Transition Guarantee is taxable income | Simplifies administration, progressivity maintained |

### Control Group and Evaluation: Total Economic Analysis

An equally large control group is followed in parallel. **IFAU** is responsible for the evaluation with a **total economic perspective**.

#### Primary Effect Measures:

* **Labor Supply:** Working hours, employment rate, transitions between employment statuses
* **Entrepreneurship:** Number of new startups, survival rate, innovation rate
* **Health:** Self-rated health (WHO-5, HADS), care consumption, sick leave, drug prescription
* **Economic Security:** Indebtedness, payment defaults, housing security

#### Total Economic Balance Sheet:

| Cost Item | Revenue Item (savings) |
| --- | --- |
| Direct payments (gross) | Saved income support, A-kassa, housing allowance |
| Possibly reduced tax revenues | Reduced sick leave costs |
| Administration Transition Guarantee | Saved administration (Public Employment Service, Social Services) |
|  | Reduced care consumption (primary care, psychiatry) |
|  | Reduced enforcement costs |
|  | Increased productivity (less stress = better cognition) |

> **Critical Hypothesis:** If sick leave for mental ill-health decreases by 15% in the trial group (reasonable based on Finnish data), it saves approx. 450 MSEK/year at national rollout. This exceeds the estimated net cost for the entire system.

The trial also tests **two models** (50% phase-out vs. tax-free floor) to empirically determine which gives the best balance between security and work incentives.

### Simplified Administration: Existing Infrastructure

Instead of building expensive real-time systems, we use the Tax Agency's established annual reconciliation process:

* **Monthly Payment:** Participants receive 12,000 SEK/month automatically (preliminary Transition Guarantee)
* **Annual Final Reconciliation:** At income declaration, exactly the right amount is calculated based on annual income
* **Repayment at Surplus:** Deducted as residual tax in final tax assessment
* **Addition at Deficit:** Refund

> **IT Cost: Near Zero.** This requires *no new IT infrastructure*. The Tax Agency already handles millions of annual reconciliations. The Transition Guarantee becomes a new line in the declaration.

### The Funding Principle and Municipal Compensation

**State Cost Guarantee:** Municipalities are compensated 100% for any increased costs for emergency assistance. SKR participates in the steering group.

### Economic Framework

#### Cost Estimate (5 years)

| Item | Amount (MSEK) | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct payments | 8,100 | 12,000 participants × 12,000 SEK/month × 60 months (gross) |
| Saved benefits | -2,400 | Replaced A-kassa, income support, housing allowance |
| Administration & IT | 45 | Minimal IT adaptation, project management, reporting |
| Municipal compensation (buffer) | 250 | State guarantee for possibly increased emergency assistance |
| Evaluation (IFAU) | 80 | Data collection, analysis, reporting, microsimulation |
| **Total Net Cost** | **6,075** | Approx. 1,215 MSEK per year (0.06% of state budget) |

> **Perspective:** 1.2 billion kronor per year corresponds to 0.06% of the state budget. Mental ill-health costs Sweden approx. 70 billion annually. If the trial shows even a 5% reduction in these costs, it has funded itself.

### Risk Assessment and Responses to Critical Objections

**LO: "This weakens the Swedish model"**
Answer: On the contrary — the separation strengthens the union's value proposition. The difference between member and non-member becomes *clearer*.

**The Moderates: "People will stop working"**
Answer: Today's income support has 100% marginal tax — the *worst* work line. The Transition Guarantee gives 50% phase-out — work pays *better* than today.

**Ministry of Finance: "Your numbers are static"**
Answer: Therefore we require total economic analysis with dynamic microsimulation as a mandatory part of the evaluation. We test the hypothesis, not claim the truth.

**SD: "Welfare tourism"**
Answer: 5 years tax history required — *stricter* than many current systems. 12,000 SEK/month is *lower* than Denmark's cash assistance.

**Business Sector: "Kills low-wage jobs"**
Answer: Yes, and that is *intended*. Sweden should compete through high productivity, not low wages. Jobs that cannot pay above subsistence minimum + travel costs *should* be automated. The Transition Guarantee pushes the Swedish economy upwards in the value chain.

**Council on Legislation: "Geographic limitation violates the Instrument of Government"**
Answer: National random selection, not geographic limitation. Accepted method.

**IT Director Social Insurance Agency: "Billions in new IT"**
Answer: No. Preliminary payment with annual tax final reconciliation. Existing Tax Agency infrastructure. IT cost: near zero.

**SKR: "Shifts costs to municipalities"**
Answer: State cost guarantee with 100% compensation. Zero cost principle guaranteed.

### Timeline for Inquiry and Implementation

| Phase | Timeframe | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inquiry | 2026 (12 months) | Inquiry appointed, detailed trial design, legal review (Council on Legislation), IT specification |
| Preparation | 2027 (12 months) | Random selection, Tax Agency adapts declaration forms, recruitment of IFAU evaluators |
| Trial | 2028-2033 (5 years) | Ongoing payments, annual reconciliation, continuous data collection, annual interim reports |
| Evaluation | 2034 (12 months) | IFAU analysis incl. total economic balance sheet, final report, recommendations |

## Conclusion

Sweden faces structural labor market changes that our current security systems are not designed for. The Transition Guarantee is not an ideological vision — it is a pragmatic adaptation to 21st-century reality.

International experiences show that basic security does not reduce willingness to work, measurably improves public health, enables innovation and entrepreneurship, and simplifies administration.

A limited pilot activity gives Sweden evidence-based basis for designing future social security systems. The cost is modest compared to the costs of mental ill-health and failed labor market integration.

To **not** test new solutions is the greatest risk-taking. The world changes — Sweden must keep up.
