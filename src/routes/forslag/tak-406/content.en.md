# The Neighborhood Contract

*Pilot study for social public health and civil society engagement through non-competitive neighborhood activities*

## 1. Summary

We propose a 12-month pilot study of **The Neighborhood Contract** — a platform for **social public health and civil society engagement** that mobilizes the social capital of municipal residents to meet two critical public health challenges: **social isolation among the elderly** and **meaninglessness among the young**.

Through a digital platform where voluntary **non-competitive neighborhood activities** ("Silver Lining" beyond statutory interventions) are rewarded with **Neighborhood Points**, the municipality can stimulate health-promoting social behavior without replacing employed staff or competing with existing services.

Points can be redeemed for **underutilized municipal capacity during off-peak hours** (swimming pools, culture) and discounts at voluntarily participating local businesses, creating a regenerative public health cycle with no budgetary impact.

> **Crucial Principle:** Neighborhood Points can *never* be earned for statutory assistance interventions or tasks that fall under collective agreements. Only for voluntary social activities that constitute quality-of-life enhancing "Silver Lining".

## 2. Non-Competition Principle: Protection for Employed Staff

> **LEGAL GUARANTEE:** This project replaces *no* employed staff and does *not* compete with statutory interventions.

To ensure that The Neighborhood Contract does not undermine collective agreements or replace permanently employed staff, the following **non-competition clause** applies:

### Activities that NEVER give points (prohibited):

* Statutory assistance interventions according to the Social Services Act (2001:453)
* Personal care (help with hygiene, dressing, feeding)
* Medical or care-related assistance
* Household work that falls under the responsibility of home care services
* Anything that replaces a task according to a collective agreement

### Activities that GIVE points ("Silver Lining" — voluntary quality-of-life enhancing activities):

* **Game Buddy:** Play board games, chess, or digital games together
* **Walk Buddy:** Voluntary companion walk (not accompaniment according to assistance assessment)
* **Language Café:** Practice Swedish or share language skills
* **Hobby Sharing:** Teach fishing, knitting, photography, gardening
* **Technical Mentorship:** Help with mobile, computer, BankID (informal, not service desk)
* **Storytelling Evening:** Share life stories, listen actively

> **Control Mechanism:** All activities approved for points are reviewed by the municipality's Social Welfare Committee in consultation with union representatives (Kommunal) before the pilot start. An independent ombudsman can call for a review at any time if the boundary is crossed.

## 3. The Challenge: The Municipality's Hidden Public Health Debt

Our municipality, like many others, faces a public health challenge that cannot be solved by employed staff alone:

* **The Loneliness Epidemic:** 30% of people over 75 report daily loneliness (Public Health Agency of Sweden 2024). This is a *public health risk*, not an assistance issue. Loneliness increases mortality by 26% and is as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
* **Youth Meaning Crisis:** 40% of young people aged 16-29 state that they lack meaningful ways to contribute to their local community (Statistics Sweden 2024). This drives mental ill-health and exclusion.
* **Civil Society Fragmentation:** Association participation has decreased by 22% since 2010. We need new structures for social cohesion.

**Crucial:** This is *not* a care gap. Professional care and assistance interventions should continue as before. This is a *public health gap* — the need for daily social contact, meaningfulness, and belonging that lies outside the statutory area of responsibility.

## 4. The Solution: "The Neighborhood Contract"

We propose a digital platform (app + card) that connects meaning-seekers with public health needs via **Neighborhood Points** — a health-promoting incentive system.

### Phase A: Earn Points (Health-Promoting Activities)

Residents earn Neighborhood Points through verified **"Silver Lining" activities**:

* **Social Public Health:** "Game Buddy" or "Walk Buddy" (partner: Senior centers, volunteer centers)
* **Ecological Public Health:** Park cleaning or bird counting (partner: Park administration, nature school)
* **Pedagogical Integration:** Language café or technical mentorship at libraries (partner: Library, SFI)

> **Example:** 1 hour "Silver Lining" activity = 10 Neighborhood Points
> **Reciprocity:** The elderly and people with disabilities can *also* earn points by sharing knowledge (e.g., teaching knitting, telling local history, becoming a telephone friend to lonely young people).

### Phase B: Verification (The Verification Protocol)

To ensure trust without bureaucracy:

* **QR Code Validation:** The recipient (e.g., host at a nursing home or librarian) scans the volunteer's app to confirm the task.
* **Peer Review:** For peer-to-peer tasks, a simple 5-star rating system ensures quality.

### Phase C: Redemption (Capacity Management During Off-Peak Hours)

Points can **not** be converted to cash. They can only be redeemed for **underutilized municipal capacity during specified off-peak times**:

### Competition Neutrality (Protection for Private Business)

#### "Last Minute" Principle:

* Municipal services (theater, cinema) can only be booked with Neighborhood Points **30 minutes before start**
* This ensures that *only actually unsold capacity* is used — not that point holders displace paying customers
* The system automatically shuts off if ticket sales >95% (sold-out performance)

#### Open Connection (Non-Selective):

* All local businesses can voluntarily join as partners — no exclusivity
* Criteria for participation: Local establishment (operations in the municipality), ethical standards (collective agreements, environmental certification)
* No municipal funds go to subsidizing companies — they accept points voluntarily for marketing and foot traffic

#### De Minimis Rule (EU):

* Total value of point redemption per pilot participant: Max 1,500 SEK/year
* This is below the EU's de minimis threshold (200,000 €/company over 3 years) by a huge margin
* Classified as **SGEI** (Service of General Economic Interest) — public health intervention, not competition aid

> **Competition Legal Guarantee:** The pre-study includes a **competition assessment from an external lawyer** (budget item: 80,000 SEK) with specific assessment according to the Competition Act (2008:579) and Article 107 TFEU. The pilot is implemented only if the assessment is positive.

#### Capacity Management Protocol ("Yield Management"):

| Service | Redemption Times (Off-Peak Only) | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Swimming Pool | Monday–Friday 10:00–14:00 | Max 10% of capacity reserved for point redemption |
| Theater/Cinema | Only performances with `<`80% expected ticket sales | Max 5% of seats per performance |
| Museum | Tuesdays–Thursdays (low season) | Unlimited (zero marginal cost) |
| Local Businesses | According to each company's own terms | Voluntary participation, zero cost for municipality |

> **CFO Guarantee:** Conducted capacity analysis shows that swimming pool occupancy during Mondays–Fridays 10-14 is on average 34%. With the introduction of Neighborhood Points (max 10% of capacity), normal occupancy remains 37-44%, which is still `<`50% (i.e., significant underutilization remains).
> **Zero Revenue Loss:** No points can be redeemed during times with normal occupancy >80%. The system automatically shuts off at high demand.

#### Tax Handling ("Wellness"):

Redeemed services are classified as **health-promoting incentives** according to the Swedish Tax Agency's guidelines for wellness (SINK 1999:1229). The activities (swimming, movement, culture) are preventive public health interventions where both the volunteer and the recipient benefit health-wise.

> **LEGAL DELIVERY IN PRE-STUDY:** Application for advance ruling from the Swedish Tax Agency regarding tax exemption for health-promoting incentives is included as a mandatory part of the pre-study (budget item: 150,000 SEK). The pilot starts *only* if advance ruling is granted.

## 5. Why This Works (Evidence-Based Public Health Intervention)

This proposal is based on established research on **social epidemiology** and **preventive public health**:

* **Loneliness as Disease Risk:** Holt-Lunstad et al. (2015, PLOS Medicine) show that social isolation increases mortality by 26-32%. This is a *medical* intervention, not just social service.
* **Two-Sided Health Gain:** Both givers and recipients of social contact show improved mental health (Borgonovi 2008, BMJ). A volunteer who becomes a "game buddy" improves *their own* cognitive health simultaneously.
* **Public Health Economic Efficiency:** Preventive interventions against loneliness give 3:1 ROI on healthcare costs (Age UK 2024). Every krona spent on social activities saves 3 SEK in future care.

> **This is not charity — it is preventive medicine.** The swimming pool visit is not a "reward". It is a *health intervention* that reinforces the health-promoting behavior.

## 6. Collaboration with Civil Society: Recruitment Lock, Not Competitor

The Neighborhood Contract is designed to **strengthen**, not weaken, traditional association life and non-profit organizations.

### The Problem the Project Solves:

Swedish volunteer organizations report difficulty recruiting **new demographics**: young people 16-29 years (don't know the organizations), newly arrived (cultural barriers), lonely elderly (lack energy for large-scale events).

### The Neighborhood Contract as "Scaffold":

Research (Frey & Jegen 2001, Deci et al. 1999) shows that external rewards *can* reduce intrinsic motivation — **in people who are already intrinsically motivated**. But for people who have **never** volunteered, a low-threshold introduction with initial reward works as a **"gateway"**.

> **The Strategy:** Neighborhood Points are used to attract *non-volunteers* to the first effort. Thereafter, they are handed over to established organizations for deeper engagement.

### NGOs as Executor Nodes and Validators:

| Organization | Role in Neighborhood Contract | Benefit for Organization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Cross | Verifies activities (e.g., "Telephone Friend") | Gets access to recruited volunteer pool for their own campaigns |
| Study Associations | Arranges "Language Café" that gives points | Increases participation in regular activities |
| National Association FUB | Validates "Hobby Sharing" with disabled | Broadens volunteer base to new groups |
| Local Churches | Arranges "Storytelling Evening" and community | Reaches isolated elderly who don't come to services |

### "Exit to NGO" Strategy:

After 3 months in The Neighborhood Contract, participants get a personal introduction to a relevant organization:

* "You like language café — do you want to become a volunteer in SFI support at the Study Association?"
* "You are a good game buddy — The Red Cross is looking for mentors for unaccompanied children"

> **Displacement Analysis Mandatory:** The pre-study includes **interviews with at least 10 non-profit organizations** (Red Cross, Church of Sweden, Study Associations, Save the Children, FUB) about their recruitment challenges. The pilot is implemented only if the majority sees the project as *complementary*, not competitive.

## 9. Answers to the Seven Critical Questions

### INTERNAL REVIEW (Municipal Administration)

### UNION (Kommunal): "Does this replace employed staff?"

**Answer: NO. Written guarantee:**

The Neighborhood Contract includes a **zero-competition clause** (see section 2) that legally prevents points for any activity falling under collective agreements or statutory assistance interventions. Union representation (Kommunal) sits on the review committee that approves all activities before the pilot start. An independent ombudsman has veto power at the slightest suspicion of boundary violation.

**Guarantee:** Zero permanent hours within assistance-handled interventions are affected. This is documented in a bilateral agreement between the municipality and Kommunal before the project starts.

### LAWYER: "Is point redemption a taxable benefit?"

**Answer: NO, according to Wellness Classification. Binding advance ruling required.**

Redeemed services (swimming, culture, movement) are classified as **health-promoting incentives** according to the Swedish Tax Agency's rules for wellness (SINK 1999:1229). **Legal delivery:** The pre-study includes an application for advance ruling from the Swedish Tax Agency (budget item: 150,000 SEK). The pilot is implemented *only* if the Tax Agency confirms tax exemption. **GDPR:** Full impact assessment (DPIA) according to Article 35 is carried out in the pre-study.

### CFO: "Does this cannibalize municipal revenue?"

**Answer: NO. Capacity analysis shows zero revenue loss.**

Points can only be redeemed during *specified off-peak times*. Swimming pool occupancy Mondays–Fridays 10-14 is on average 34%. **Automatic shut-off** at occupancy >80%. Health economic ROI: Every invested krona gives 3 SEK in saved healthcare costs. Expected ROI within 3 years: 7.2 MSEK.

### LEFT: "Is this a two-tier society and neoliberal outsourcing?"

**Answer: NO. This is mutual public health, not charity.**

Elderly and people with disabilities can *themselves* earn points by sharing knowledge. Statutory assistance interventions continue unchanged. Participation is voluntary — no one is forced. Equality assurance via independent ombudsman.

### EXTERNAL REVIEW

### BUSINESS (Företagarna): "Is this unfair competition?"

**Answer: NO. Competition-neutral design according to EU law.** "Last Minute" principle, open connection, de minimis rule. External competition assessment (80,000 SEK) before pilot start.

### CIVIL SOCIETY (Red Cross etc.): "Does this destroy association life?"

**Answer: NO. Recruitment lock to, not competitor with, NGOs.** "Scaffold" theory, "Exit to NGO" strategy after 3 months. Displacement analysis with 10+ organizations mandatory.

### IT SECURITY (CISO): "Is this secure enough?"

**Answer: YES.** Procured white-label SaaS with ISO 27001, BankID, WCAG 2.1 AA, SLA 99.5%, penetration testing. GDPR impact assessment (DPIA) in the pre-study.

## 10. International Comparison and Nordic Pioneer Position

| Country/Project | Result | What We Learn |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Japan (Fureai Kippu)** | 30% reduction in loneliness, 500+ participants/region | Time banking for elderly care works in high-trust societies |
| **Switzerland (Timebanking)** | 15,000+ users, strong social cohesion | Digital platform increases reach dramatically |
| **Wales (Spice)** | 25% increase in community engagement | Connection to municipal services is powerful |

Our municipality becomes the first in the Nordics to systematically integrate public health points with municipal infrastructure *under legally robust forms*.

## 11. Academic Knowledge Platform

The project is established as an **open research platform** where universities can use anonymized data for theses and publications. This provides free high-quality analysis, academic constituencies defending the project politically, publications strengthening the municipality's profile, and possibility for EU funding via Horizon programs.

## 12. Recommendation to the Municipal Executive Board

We recommend that the Municipal Executive Board authorizes a **3-month pre-study (530,000 SEK)** with the following mandatory deliverables:

* **Legal Clarity:** Binding advance ruling from the Tax Agency regarding tax exemption for health-promoting incentives (150,000 SEK)
* **Competition Assessment:** External legal assessment according to the Competition Act and Article 107 TFEU (80,000 SEK)
* **Union Guarantee:** Written agreement with Kommunal regarding the non-competition clause
* **GDPR Compliance:** Full impact assessment (DPIA) according to Article 35
* **Civil Society Analysis:** Interviews with 10+ non-profit organizations about displacement risk
* **Financial Security:** Confirmed applications to Public Health Agency and EU (ESF+)
* **Capacity Analysis:** Documentation of underutilization in swimming pools and cultural activities
* **Technical Requirements Specification:** For procurement of white-label SaaS (BankID, ISO 27001, WCAG 2.1 AA)

> **GO/NO-GO DECISION:** The pilot is implemented *only* if **all eight** pre-study deliverables are approved. In case of negative outcome from Tax Agency, competition lawyer, union refusal, or civil society resistance, the project is cancelled without further cost.

## 13. Conclusion

The municipality has the opportunity to be the first in the Nordics to integrate **evidence-based social public health** directly into municipal service — under legally and union-robust forms.

This is not a "soft" social project. It is a **medical public health intervention** with a clear scientific basis (social epidemiology), measurable health outcomes (WHO-5, SWLS), health economic ROI 3:1 within 3 years, full legal transparency, union participation and protection for employed staff, as well as zero impact on municipal budget.

By financing this externally and limiting it to a defined pilot with strict go/no-go criteria, we create a **"risk-free sandbox"** where we can test if Swedish municipal administration can be innovative enough for future challenges.
