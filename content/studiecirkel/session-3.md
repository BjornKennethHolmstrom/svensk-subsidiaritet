# Meeting 3: Subsidiarity - The Solution Has a Name

**Goal:** Participants should understand what subsidiarity (proximity rule) means and be able to see concrete examples of how it works in practice.

**Materials you need:**

* Fika
* Printed example cards (see below)
* Large papers for brainstorming
* Flipchart with compasses from previous meetings put up
* Optional: Pictures of working examples (can be shown on phone/computer)

---

## 0-10 min: Welcome + Recap-check-in

**What you say:**

> "Welcome to meeting three! We are halfway through now. Today will be more hopeful than before—we are talking about solutions, not just problems.
> But first: quick recap. What do you remember from last time? What was the name of the tool we learned?"

[Let someone answer: "The Proximity Compass"]

> "Exactly! The compass with power, knowledge, resilience. And what did we see when we mapped Swedish systems?"

[Let the group answer: "Pointy triangles, centralized, vulnerable"]

> "Precisely. Today we are going to talk about the opposite: systems that are *wide*—where power sits close, local knowledge counts, and there are backup plans.
> Check-in: One round. Name and a system you yourself would like to see work differently. Not necessarily fix—just do *differently*. I’ll start..."

**Write down the systems they mention—you will return to them later.**

## 10-30 min: The Concept of Subsidiarity

**What you say:**

> "Okay, now comes a tricky word: **subsidiarity**. It sounds like something from EU bureaucrats, but it is actually much simpler than that.
> Subsidiarity means: **No power should lie higher up than necessary.**
> Or in plain Swedish: **Närstyre (Proximity rule).**
> Or even simpler: **What can be done locally, *should* be done locally.**"

**Draw this pyramid on flipchart:**

```
        EU
       ----
      Region
     --------
    Municipality
   --------------
  Neighborhood
 ----------------
Family/Individual

```

> "Today power usually goes top-down: EU decides, then the region, then the municipality, then YOU have to comply.
> Subsidiarity flips that: You and your neighbors decide. If you can't handle it, the neighborhood helps. If the neighborhood can't handle it, the municipality helps. And so on upwards.
> Thus: start from the bottom, go upwards *only if necessary*."

### Example (5 minutes):

> "Take school food. Subsidiarity would mean:
> * **Can the school kitchen decide?** Yes? Then they should be allowed to do so.
> * **Do they need help with procurement?** Okay, the municipality can fix that.
> * **Does it need national safety requirements?** Sure, the National Agency for Education can set minimum standards.
> 
> 
> But IT STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM. Not from the top.
> Today it starts with the National Agency for Education writing rules, then the municipality procuring, then the kitchen executing. It is upside-down."

**Write on flipchart:**

```
TODAY:        EU → Region → Municipality → You
SUBSIDIARITY: You → Neighborhood → Municipality → Region → EU
              (start locally, go up if necessary)

```

### Why this is important (5 minutes):

> "Why would this be better? Three reasons:
> **1. LOCAL KNOWLEDGE:** Those who live in a system know things that remote experts never learn.
> Example: The kitchen knows which children are allergic, what food is actually eaten up.
> **2. SPEED:** Decisions on site are faster than waiting for a regional meeting.
> Example: If delivery fails, the kitchen can call local farmers directly.
> **3. RESPONSIBILITY:** When you see the effect of your decisions every day, you become more responsible.
> Example: The school kitchen sees the children eat (or not eat). Regional politicians see Excel sheets."

## 30-60 min: Concrete Examples - "This is what it can look like"

**What you say:**

> "Now we are going to look at real examples where subsidiarity actually works. Not hypothetically—but here and now, in Sweden or our neighboring countries.
> I have made cards with five examples. We divide into small groups. Each group gets a card, reads it, and discusses: *Could this work here with us?*
> You have 15 minutes. Then you present to the others."

### Example cards (print out or read aloud):

---

**CARD 1: FOOD GUILDS (Borlänge, Sweden)**

**What:** 50 households join together and buy food directly from local farmers. Every week "food bags" are delivered to a central point. Members share the cost.

**How it works:**

* A group of 3-5 people organizes procurement and logistics.
* Farmers get paid better (no middlemen).
* Consumers save 20-30% compared to grocery stores.
* Everything is seasonal and local.

**Subsidiarity principle:**

* Power: With the members (they decide what is bought).
* Knowledge: The farmer knows what is in season, members know what they want.
* Resilience: If the grocery store closes, alternatives exist; several local farmers instead of one central warehouse.

**Question to the group:** Are there local farmers here you could contact? Does anyone of you know someone?

---

**CARD 2: NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE (Vivalla, Örebro)**

**What:** A neighborhood has a common "storage" where everyone can borrow tools, lawnmowers, toys, skis, etc. Instead of 50 families owning 50 drills, they own 3 together.

**How it works:**

* The association rents a basement space.
* Members contribute things they don't use often.
* Digital booking calendar (or just a list on the door).
* Annual fee: 500 SEK/family.

**Subsidiarity principle:**

* Power: With the neighbors (they decide rules and what can be there).
* Knowledge: Someone who can fix stuff becomes "storage host".
* Resilience: Less dependent on stores; can borrow from neighbors.

**Question to the group:** Is there an empty space or basement in your area? What would you like to share?

---

**CARD 3: SAFETY RINGS (Rinkeby, Stockholm)**

**What:** 80 neighbors in a block have a WhatsApp group and a rotating "safety shift". Different people walk a round at 21:00 every evening, make sure everything is okay, greet people.

**How it works:**

* No weapons, no power to arrest—only *presence*.
* If something is wrong, they call the police.
* People feel safer because they see familiar faces.
* Youths feel seen (not chased).

**Subsidiarity principle:**

* Power: With the neighborhood (they decide schedule and rules).
* Knowledge: They recognize who lives there and who doesn't.
* Resilience: If the police can't come, neighbors are still there.

**Question to the group:** Would you feel safer with more known faces out in the evening? would you walk a round yourselves?

---

**CARD 4: ENERGY COOPERATIVE (Klinte, Gotland)**

**What:** 25 households joined together and bought solar panels together. They produce more electricity than they need and sell the surplus back to the grid.

**How it works:**

* Group purchase gave 40% discount on the panels.
* The cooperative owns the facility jointly.
* Profit is distributed or reinvested.
* If the grid goes down, they can still have electricity locally (with battery).

**Subsidiarity principle:**

* Power: With the members (they decide how profit is used).
* Knowledge: Local technician installs and maintains.
* Resilience: Not dependent on Vattenfall; own production.

**Question to the group:** Do you have roofs that could have solar panels? Do you know anyone who knows installation?

---

**CARD 5: COHOUSING (Färdknäppen, Stockholm)**

**What:** 50 apartments with common dining room, laundry room, workshop, children's room. People eat together 3 times a week (if they want). Children play together. Elderly get company.

**How it works:**

* Everyone has their own apartment but large common areas.
* Cooking rotates (everyone cooks for 50 people 2-3 times/year instead of cooking for 3 people 365 times/year).
* Childcare shares responsibility—"it takes a village".
* Elderly don't become lonely—always people to talk to.

**Subsidiarity principle:**

* Power: With the housing association (they decide rules).
* Knowledge: Those who live there know what is needed.
* Resilience: Less vulnerable to loneliness, isolation, childcare crisis.

**Question to the group:** Would you like to eat dinner with neighbors sometimes? Or is it too much?

---

**Divide into groups, hand out cards.**

**15 minutes discussion.**

**Walk around and listen:**

* If they say "but that won't work here": "Why not? What would be needed?"
* If they say "it sounds good but...": "Okay, what is the 'but'? What stops you?"

**After 15 min:**

> "Okay, let's hear. Each group gets 3 minutes to tell:
> 1. Which example you got.
> 2. Could it work here?
> 3. If yes—what would be required? If no—what is the obstacle?"
> 
> 

**Each group presents.**

**After each group:**

* "Thank you! Anyone else want to comment?"
* Write down on flipchart: "WOULD WORK" and "OBSTACLES"—gather insights.

## 60-75 min: "But what about...?" - Common Objections

**What you say:**

> "I hear that several of you are both attracted and skeptical. That is healthy. Let's talk about the most common objections to subsidiarity."

**Go through these (3 min per objection):**

### Objection 1: "But lagom then? Swedes don't want to stand out!"

**Answer:**

> "Lagom is not the same as passivity. Lagom is balance. And right now the balance is disturbed—way too much power lies too far away.
> Besides: when YOU and your neighbors decide, NO ONE stands out. You do it together. That is actually lagom."

### Objection 2: "But some people must decide! Otherwise it will be chaos!"

**Answer:**

> "Absolutely! Subsidiarity doesn't mean that *no one* decides. It means that the *right level* decides.
> Defense? Yes, the state should handle that. Nuclear power? Maybe at national level. But school food? Why must Stockholm decide that?"

### Objection 3: "It sounds like work. I don't have time!"

**Answer:**

> "Fair point. And here is the beauty: not everyone needs to do everything.
> In food guilds: 3-5 people handle logistics, 45 others just pick up their bags.
> In the safety ring: you walk a round one evening per month, the rest of the time you get safety for free.
> It is *less* work than always fixing everything yourself AND paying others to do it."

### Objection 4: "But there is a reason we centralized!"

**Answer:**

> "YES! Absolutely! In the 20th century centralization worked because:
> * Problems were identical everywhere (same diseases, same needs).
> * Information was expensive and slow.
> * Only experts had knowledge.
> 
> 
> But now:
> * Problems are unique (your family ≠ my family).
> * Information is fast and free (we have internet).
> * Knowledge is distributed (YouTube can teach you to fix taps).
> 
> 
> The world has changed. Our systems haven't kept up."

## 75-85 min: Future Vision + Next Steps

**What you say:**

> "Good discussions! Now you know what subsidiarity means and you have seen five working examples.
> Next time—our last joint meeting—we are going to do something real: **Decide ONE concrete thing you are going to do here, within 30 days.**
> Not talk about. Not plan. Do.
> Until then: think about these examples. Which felt most exciting? Which most possible? Which would make the biggest difference for your daily life?
> Feel free to write down thoughts on a note and bring next time. We are going to build an action plan together."

**Date and time for meeting 4.**

---

## 85-90 min: Check-out

> "Last round: One word for how you feel now. More hopeful, less hopeful, confused, inspired—whatever it is. I’ll start..."

**Closing:**

> "Thank you for coming and for daring to think that something else is possible. That is the first step. See you for the last time next [day]!"

## Handout to distribute

**Meeting 3 - Summary: Subsidiarity**

**What is subsidiarity?**
"No power should lie higher up than necessary."
= Proximity rule
= What can be done locally, SHOULD be done locally.

**Why?**

1. Local knowledge—those living in the system know more than remote experts.
2. Speed—decisions on site are fast.
3. Responsibility—you see the effect of your choices every day.

**Five working examples:**

1. Food Guilds (Borlänge) - directly from the farmer
2. Neighborhood House (Vivalla) - share tools and stuff
3. Safety Rings (Rinkeby) - neighbors who care
4. Energy Cooperative (Gotland) - own electricity, together
5. Cohousing (Färdknäppen) - share life, not just the roof

**Next time:**
We choose ONE thing to actually do. Bring ideas!

## Troubleshooting Meeting 3

**"But that's communism/libertarianism/[political ideology]!":**

* "Subsidiarity is not a party. It is used by the Catholic church, EU, and libertarians. It is not right or left—it is 'closer is better'."

**"Who is going to pay for this?":**

* "Good question! Many examples are *cheaper* than current systems. Food guilds save money. Neighborhood houses save money. But yes, some things need start-up capital."

**"I don't want responsibility for my neighbor's safety!":**

* "You don't have to! Safety rings mean more eyes see, not that you become police. You can still call 112."

**"Sounds too complicated!":**

* "Fair. But compare with current hassle: four authorities to change address? Wait 6 months for doctor? Choose your hassle."
