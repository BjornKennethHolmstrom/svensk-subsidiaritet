# Meeting 1: The Swedish Paradox - The Diagnosis

**Goal:** Participants should recognize system dysfunction in their own daily lives and understand that the problem is not "stupid politicians" but the system architecture itself.

**Materials you need:**

* Fika (coffee, tea, something to eat)
* Large index cards (A5) and pens for everyone
* Flipchart or large paper for the wall
* Optional: Printout of "System Barometer" (see below)

## 0-10 min: Welcome and Check-in

**What you say (exactly):**

> "Welcome, everyone. Thank you for coming. I am [your name] and I will be your host during these four meetings.
> I have invited you here because I believe we need to talk in a new way about why things feel so difficult in our society. Not by complaining about politicians or parties, but by looking at the *systems* themselves—how decisions are made, where knowledge is located, who has power.
> I don't have ready-made answers. But I have some good questions and some tools to understand better. And I have coffee.
> We will meet four times. Today: diagnosis—what feels wrong? Next time: an analysis tool. The third time: solutions that actually work. The fourth time: something small we can do here and now.
> The only requirement is that you listen and share what you are comfortable sharing. No pressure. No one gets homework. We start exactly on time and end exactly on time—out of respect for your babysitters and bus schedules.
> Before we get started, let's go around the circle. Say your name and one word for how it feels to be here tonight. I’ll start: [your name], and I feel... curious."

**Facilitation tips:**

* After each person, say "Thank you, [name]"—this acknowledges them and creates a rhythm.
* If someone says more than one word, let it flow—the first time is nervous.
* If there is silence: wait 7 seconds before moving on to the next person.

## 10-25 min: Shared Reading + Concept Introduction

**What you say:**

> "Thank you for your check-in. Now we are going to read a little together. I will read aloud from a short manifesto that explains why centralized systems—which worked well in the 20th century—have become our problem in the 21st century. While I read, think about if anything feels familiar."

**Read aloud (5 minutes):**

*Choose 2-3 paragraphs from your manifesto text or use this shortened version:*

> "Sweden has built the world's most impressive systems. Healthcare for everyone. School for everyone. Care for everyone. But somewhere along the way, something happened: the systems became so large and complex that they no longer see the people.
> It is called centralization. The idea was good: if we gather experts in Stockholm, we get better decisions. If we standardize processes, it becomes fair. If we do everything the same everywhere, it becomes efficient.
> But that only worked as long as the problems were simple and identical. Today, reality is more complicated. Your daily life in Kiruna is not the same as someone's daily life in Malmö. Your family is not identical to your neighbor's. Your health does not follow the manual.
> And yet, the systems treat us as if we were identical. The same healthcare queues. The same curriculum. The same benefit rules. We have optimized for efficiency but forgotten the human."

**Key concepts to explain:**

1. **Centralization:** "When decisions are made at the national or regional level instead of locally. Example: The Transport Administration in Borlänge decides about your village bus."
2. **Monoculture:** "When you do everything the same everywhere. Efficient but vulnerable—like when all potatoes are the same variety and a disease wipes out the whole crop."
3. **System Architecture:** "How something is built from the ground up. Not *who* governs but *how* power and knowledge are distributed in the structure itself."

**Write on flipchart:**

* CENTRALIZATION = Decisions are made far away
* MONOCULTURE = The same solution everywhere
* SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE = How power is built

## 25-35 min: System Barometer (Individual Exercise)

**What you say:**

> "Now we are going to do a quick exercise. You will each get a paper with a list of Swedish systems you have probably encountered recently. I want you to mark how it feels when you encounter them. There is no right or wrong—only your experience."

**Hand out cards with this table (or draw on flipchart if you are few):**

```
System                    | Feel seen       | Feel like a number
--------------------------|-----------------|---------------------
Health Center (Vårdcentral)| ☐               | ☐
Social Insurance Agency   | ☐               | ☐
School                    | ☐               | ☐
Grocery Store (ICA/Coop)  | ☐               | ☐
Municipality Website      | ☐               | ☐
The Bank                  | ☐               | ☐
The Police                | ☐               | ☐
Public Transport (SL/etc.)| ☐               | ☐

```

**Give 5 minutes of quiet time.**

**After 5 minutes, say:**

> "Okay, we won't go through all your answers individually—that takes too long. But I want you to look at your own answers. Is there a pattern? Which systems get more checks in the 'like a number' column?
> Raise your hand if at least half of your checks ended up in the 'like a number' column."

**Count hands, say:**

> "Interesting. [X] of you feel more often like a number than like a person when you meet Swedish systems. It's not because the people working there are mean. It's because the systems are built to handle 10 million Swedes with the same process. And then you become mathematics, not a human."

## 35-60 min: Group Discussion - The System Swamp in Daily Life

**What you say:**

> "Now we are going to talk together. I have three questions and we will take them in order. We go one round around the circle for each question. You can pass if you want, but try to share something small if you can. Remember: we are criticizing *systems*, not the *people* who work in them."

### Question 1 (15 min): Where do you meet the "system"?

**Facilitation:**

* Start yourself with an example: "I tried to change my address last month and it required five different authorities..."
* Go around the circle.
* If someone mentions a person: "Thank you, and what system do you think put that person in that situation?"
* If someone takes too long (>2 min): "Thank you [name], that was a good example. Shall we move on so everyone gets space?"

**Write down on flipchart:** Which systems are mentioned most? (Social Insurance Agency, healthcare, school usually top the list).

### Question 2 (10 min): Near or far away?

> "Next question: Think about the latest decision that affected your daily life—perhaps a school change, a bus that stops running, a healthcare rule. Do you feel that decision was made close to you or far away? Why do you think that?"

**Facilitation:**

* Less formal round—people can build on each other's answers.
* Listen for: "Stockholm", "The Region", "EU" vs. "Our principal", "The neighbor".
* Summarize: "I hear many examples of decisions made far from your daily life. Do you agree that this is a pattern?"

### Question 3 (10 min): When standard doesn't work

> "Last question for today: Has anyone encountered a situation where the 'standard solution' didn't fit your unique situation? Perhaps a form that didn't have an option for you, or a rule that didn't see your reality?"

**Facilitation:**

* This often becomes emotional—allow pauses, validate feelings.
* If someone gets angry at "bureaucrats": "I hear your frustration. What do you think it is in the *system* that made it so that bureaucrat couldn't help you?"
* Summarize: "The pattern I hear is: the rules are built for the 'average Swede' and when you deviate, the system becomes blind."

## 60-75 min: Intro to Next Meeting + Homework

**What you say:**

> "We have talked a lot about problems today. Good. Diagnosis first. But next time we are going to learn to analyze *why* the systems work this way. We will use a tool called 'The Proximity Compass'—it helps us see where power sits, whose knowledge counts, and how vulnerable something is.
> Until next time, you have a small task, if you want: Bring an example of a *local resource* that the system misses. It could be:
> * A person with a skill (someone who can fix, grow, build, translate)
> * A place (an empty room, a piece of land, a storage shed)
> * A knowledge (something you know about your area that experts in Stockholm don't know)
> 
> 
> Write it down on a note and bring it next time. We are going to build a 'treasure map' together."

**Hand out small notes and pens.**

---

## 75-85 min: Summary + Next Steps

**What you say:**

> "Before we finish, let me summarize what we learned today:
> 1. Swedish systems are built for *standardization*—good for efficiency, bad for unique humans.
> 2. Many of you feel like *numbers* more often than like *persons* when you meet these systems.
> 3. Decisions that affect you are often made *far away* by people who don't know your reality.
> 
> 
> This is not because politicians or officials are stupid. It is because the *architecture*—the way it is built—is wrong for today's complex reality.
> Next time, [date and time], we take the next step: we learn to *diagnose* where power and knowledge sit. Feel free to invite a neighbor or colleague—the more perspectives, the better."

**Practicalities:**

* "Can everyone come next time? [Look around.]"
* "Does anyone need a ride or help with childcare? [Solve practically.]"
* "Contact info—should we have a WhatsApp group? [If the group wants.]"

---

## 85-90 min: Check-out

**What you say:**

> "Last time around the circle for today: one word for how you feel *now*, after this conversation. I’ll start: [your word - e.g., 'hopeful', 'tired', 'curious']."

**Go one round.**

**Closing:**

> "Thank you for coming and for daring to share. See you on [date]!"

## If Something Goes Wrong - Troubleshooting

**No one talks:**

* "Let's take 30 seconds individually and write down a thought first, then we share."

**One person dominates:**

* "Thank you [name], that was valuable. Now I would really like to hear from [someone else]."

**Political debate starts:**

* "I hear that many have strong feelings about party politics. But today we are focusing on the system *behind* the politics. Next question..."

**Someone becomes emotional:**

* "This is an important topic that affects us. Let's take a short break. Coffee?"

**Time runs out:**

* Skip question 3, go directly to summary at 75 min. Better to end on time than to stress.

## Handout to distribute (summary)

**Meeting 1 - Summary**

**What we learned:**

* Centralization = decisions are made far away from you
* Monoculture = the same solution everywhere (efficient but vulnerable)
* System Architecture = how power is *built*, not who holds it

**Next time:**
We learn "The Proximity Compass"—a tool to diagnose where power and knowledge sit.

**Your homework (optional):**
Write down a local resource that "the system" doesn't see:

* A person's skill
* A place
* A knowledge
