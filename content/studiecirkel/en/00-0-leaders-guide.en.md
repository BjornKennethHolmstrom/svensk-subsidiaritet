# Facilitator's Guide: Leading Conversations on Systems Change

**Welcome.**
You are holding the toolkit to start a conversation that society desperately needs. This study circle is not about party politics. It is about **systems literacy**.

## Your Role
You are not a teacher. You are a **gardener**.
Your task is not to provide the answers, but to ensure that all voices have the space to grow.

## Structure (4 Meetings)
1.  **The Diagnosis:** Why does everything feel so sluggish and bureaucratic?
2.  **The Compass:** Measuring Power, Knowledge, and Vulnerability.
3.  **The Solution:** What actually is Subsidiarity (Local Governance)?
4.  **The Action:** What can we do right here, right now?

## Golden Rules
* **Systems, not People:** If someone complains about "Politician X," redirect to "What incentives drive Politician X?"
* **Round the Table:** Ensure the quiet voices are heard.
* **Fika:** The most important technology for Swedish collaboration. Coffee/tea is mandatory.
