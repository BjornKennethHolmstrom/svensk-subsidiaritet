# Meeting 2: The Proximity Compass

## Introduction
Last time, we discussed the problem. Now, we will learn to **diagnose** it. We will use a tool called "The Proximity Compass."

## Exercise: Mapping the Power (60 min)
Choose a local issue (e.g., "School Lunches," "The Bus Route," or "Elder Care").
Draw a triangle on a piece of paper and discuss the three corners:

### Corner 1: Power (Where?)
* Who decides the budget?
* Stockholm? The Region? Or us here in this room?

### Corner 2: Knowledge (Who?)
* Whose knowledge counts?
* The expert's statistics or the experience of those living it?

### Corner 3: Resilience (What happens in crisis?)
* If the internet/power goes down, does it still work?
* Are we dependent on imports, or can we sustain ourselves?

## Discussion
* What is the "shape" of your problem? Is it a sharp triangle (centralized) or a broad one (local)?
* What would it take to move power one step closer to us?
