# Meeting 2: The Proximity Compass - The Tool for Diagnosis

**Goal:** Participants should be able to use the Proximity Compass to analyze WHERE power sits, WHOSE knowledge counts, and HOW vulnerable the system is.

**Materials you need:**

* Fika
* Printed compass templates (one per person + a large one on the flipchart)
* Markers or pens in three colors
* Notes from last time (local resources)
* Optional: Post-it notes in three colors

## 0-10 min: Welcome Back + Check-in

**What you say:**

> "Welcome back! Great to see you again. For those of you who are new today: we are in meeting 2 of 4 where we learn to understand systems instead of just complaining about them.
> Last time we talked about the *problem*—that Swedish systems feel bureaucratic and impersonal. Today we are going to learn a *tool* to understand why.
> But first: check-in. One round around the circle. Say your name and: What local resource did you think of since last time? A person, a place, or knowledge that 'the system' misses. I’ll start: [your name], and I thought of [example - e.g., 'my neighbor who can fix anything' or 'that empty space by the square']."

**Facilitation tips:**

* Collect the physical notes in a pile in the middle of the circle—"Our treasure map is growing!"
* If someone forgot: "No worries, you can add it later."
* If someone new arrived: "Welcome! We start every time with a check-in so everyone gets warmed up."

## 10-30 min: Introduction to The Proximity Compass

**What you say:**

> "Thank you for your check-in. Now we are going to learn today's tool: **The Proximity Compass**. It is a triangle with three corners that helps us understand how power and knowledge are distributed in a system.
> Why a triangle? Because these three things hang together. If you change one, you affect the others.
> Let me show you."

**Draw a large triangle on the flipchart with these three corners:**

```
                    POWER
                   (Decision)
                      △
                     /  \
                    /    \
                   /      \
                  /        \
                 /          \
        KNOWLEDGE ----------- RESILIENCE
        (Who knows?)         (What happens 
                             in a crisis?)

```

### Explain each corner (5 min per corner):

**1. POWER (Decision) - From where is the decision made?**

> "This isn't about *who* is mean or kind. It is about: at what level are decisions made?
> Example: School food in Kiruna.
> * Is the decision made by the school kitchen? (Local = close to you)
> * Is it made by the municipality? (Regional = fairly close)
> * Is it made by the National Agency for Education in Stockholm? (National = far away)
> * Or by EU directives? (Supranational = very far away)
> 
> 
> The further away the decision is made, the less it can be adapted to YOUR school's specific needs."

**2. KNOWLEDGE (Who knows?) - Whose expertise counts?**

> "Every system has different types of knowledge. Sometimes they are valued differently.
> Example: Healthcare.
> * The doctor's medical education (Formal expertise)
> * The nurse's experience from 20 years on the ward (Practical expertise)
> * The patient's knowledge of their own body (Lived experience)
> 
> 
> Often only the first one counts. But without the other two, you miss important things. Whose knowledge does the system listen to?"

**3. RESILIENCE (What happens in a crisis?) - How vulnerable is the system?**

> "This is about: If something goes wrong, will we cope?
> Example: Food supply.
> * If Sweden imports 50% of food: What happens if borders close?
> * If everything is controlled digitally: What happens if the internet goes down?
> * If only ICA (major grocery chain) exists: What happens if they go bankrupt?
> 
> 
> A robust system has *redundancy*—several ways to achieve the same thing. A vulnerable system has *one solution*. If that fails, everything fails."

**Write on flipchart:**

```
POWER:      Central (Stockholm/EU) ←→ Local (Here)
KNOWLEDGE:  Expert (Certificate)   ←→ Local (Experience)
RESILIENCE: Vulnerable (One way)   ←→ Robust (Many ways)

```

## 30-35 min: Demonstration Example (We do one together)

**What you say:**

> "Now we will test the compass on an example together before you do your own. We'll take something everyone knows: **Systembolaget** (The state alcohol monopoly). Or if you prefer: a bus line, a health center, school food—vote!"

**Let the group choose. Use their choice. I will demonstrate with Systembolaget:**

**Hand out empty compass templates to everyone.**

> "Okay, Systembolaget. Let's fill in the compass together.
> **POWER:** Who decides on Systembolaget's opening hours, assortment, prices?
> [Let the group answer. Correct answer: The Swedish state via monopoly, Parliament, Systembolaget AB]
> * Local influence? Almost none. You cannot start your own shop.
> * Mark furthest out towards 'Central' on the scale."
> 
> 

> **KNOWLEDGE:** Whose knowledge is valued?
> [Let the group answer]
> * Sommeliers? Systembolaget's buyers? Yes.
> * Your local vineyard that wants to sell directly? No, must go through the system.
> * Mark: Expert knowledge counts, local does not."
> 
> 

> **RESILIENCE:** If Systembolaget closes, can you get alcohol legally in Sweden another way?
> [Let the group answer: No (except restaurants)]
> * Very vulnerable—only ONE channel.
> * Mark: Low resilience."
> 
> 

**Show the finished compass:**

```
         POWER
      (Central)
          △
         /  \
        /    \
       /      \
KNOWLEDGE ----- RESILIENCE
(Expert)       (Vulnerable)

```

> "See, a pointy triangle tilting upwards and right. That means: Power far away, only expert knowledge counts, vulnerable system. That is typical for centralized monopolies."

---

## 35-65 min: Group Exercise - Map a Local Problem

**What you say:**

> "Now it's your turn. You will choose a local problem and map it using the compass. Work in small groups of 2-4 people.
> Choose one of these (or suggest your own):
> * The school food in [your municipality]
> * Bus line [X] that stopped running
> * Wait times at the health center
> * Elderly care home in your area
> 
> 
> You have 30 minutes. Fill in the compass and be prepared to present."

**Divide into groups (if >6 people).**

**Hand out:**

* 1 large compass template per group
* Colored markers
* Paper for notes

### Guidance while they work (5 min per group, rotate):

**Walk around and help the groups:**

If they get stuck on **POWER:**

* "Start with a concrete question: Who decides the budget?"
* "If you don't know, guess! We can check later."

If they get stuck on **KNOWLEDGE:**

* "What kind of knowledge is required to do the job?"
* "Whose voice does the system *not* listen to?"

If they get stuck on **RESILIENCE:**

* "Think: If this system stops working tomorrow, what happens?"
* "Are there alternatives?"

**After 20 min, give a 10-minute warning.**

**After 30 min:**

> "Okay, pens down! Now every group gets 3 minutes to present their compass. Show your triangle and briefly explain why it looks the way it does."

**Each group presents (3-4 min per group):**

* Which problem did you choose?
* What does your compass look like?
* What surprised you?

**After each presentation:**

* "Thank you! Questions from anyone else? [Max 1 question]"
* Hang their compass up on the wall.

## 65-80 min: Joint Reflection - Patterns We See

**What you say:**

> "Thank you for your presentations. Now let's step back and look at all the compasses we created. Look at the wall. Do you see any patterns?"

**Silent observation for 30 seconds.**

**Ask these questions, one at a time:**

### Question 1 (5 min): Shape patterns

> "What do most triangles look like? Pointy upwards (centralized) or wide downwards (local)?"

[Let the group answer. Likely: Most are pointy.]

> "Exactly. Most Swedish systems today are built with power centrally, expert knowledge dominant, and low resilience. It's not a coincidence—it is 20th-century architecture."

### Question 2 (5 min): The Knowledge Gap

> "Whose knowledge is ignored in these systems? Raise your hand if you see an example where local experience doesn't count."

[Many hands, probably.]

> "This is the core of the problem. The system thinks expert knowledge in Stockholm is enough. But expert-at-a-distance can never replace knowledge-in-context."

### Question 3 (5 min): Resilience Vulnerability

> "Which systems feel most vulnerable? If they break, do we have backup?"

[Discussion.]

> "I hear: [summarize]. The Swedish welfare society has *efficiency* but not *redundancy*. We put all our eggs in one basket because it was cheaper. Now we are vulnerable."

---

## 80-85 min: Future Vision + Next Meeting

**What you say:**

> "Great work today! You can now diagnose systems. You see where power sits, whose knowledge counts, how vulnerable it is.
> But diagnosis is only step one. Next time we will talk about: **What is the solution?**
> Spoiler alert: It is called *subsidiarity*. In Swedish: *närstyre* (proximity rule). Or even simpler: moving power closer to the people affected.
> Until next time: Take your compass and think of a system you yourself want to *change*. Not just understand—but actually do differently. We will start building solutions.
> [Date and time for next meeting]."

---

## 85-90 min: Check-out

**What you say:**

> "Last round: One word for how you feel now, after learning the compass. I’ll start: [your word - e.g., 'clearer', 'angry', 'hopeful']."

**Closing:**

> "Thank you for coming and for thinking so sharply. Take your compass templates home if you want. See you next time!"

## Handout to distribute

**Meeting 2 - Summary: The Proximity Compass**

**The three corners:**

1. **POWER:** From where are decisions made?
* Central (Stockholm/EU/Region) or Local (Here)?


2. **KNOWLEDGE:** Whose expertise counts?
* Formal (certificates, education) or Local (experience, context)?


3. **RESILIENCE:** How vulnerable is the system?
* One solution (vulnerable) or Multiple alternatives (robust)?



**How to use the compass:**

1. Choose a system (school food, bus, healthcare, etc.).
2. Ask for each corner: Where are we on the scale?
3. Draw the triangle.
4. Interpret the shape:
* Pointy upwards = Centralized.
* Wide downwards = Local.



**Next time:**
We learn *subsidiarity*—how to move power closer to people.

* [ ] Presentations
* [ ] Joint reflection
* [ ] Check-out

## Troubleshooting Meeting 2

**Groups don't understand the compass:**

* Go back to the Systembolaget example.
* Draw clearer: "Central" at the very top, "Local" at the very bottom.

**They want to talk politics instead of systems:**

* "Good point, but let's keep focus on the structure, not the parties. Whose system wins the election matters less if the system itself is built wrong."

**All compasses look the same:**

* "Exactly! Most Swedish systems have the same shape. What does that say about our society?"

**Someone says 'But centralization IS good!':**

* "Absolutely, it can be—for certain things. The question is: for what? Defense? Yes. Your school food? Maybe not."
