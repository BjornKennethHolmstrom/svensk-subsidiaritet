## 0-10 min: Final Check-in + Recap

**What you say:**

> "Welcome to our last joint meeting! We have met four times. That deserves a round of applause."

[Applause for yourselves.]

> "Let's remember the road here:
> * Meeting 1: We saw the problem—centralization that created bureaucracy.
> * Meeting 2: We learned the tool—The Proximity Compass.
> * Meeting 3: We saw the solution—subsidiarity and working examples.
> * Today: We choose something to actually DO.
> 
> 
> Check-in: One round. Name and: Have you thought of something since last time? An example that stuck? An idea that nagged at you? I’ll start..."

**Write down what people say—some things will return later.**

## 10-40 min: Treasure Map - Our Local Assets

**What you say:**

> "Before we decide *what* to do, we need to know *what we have*. We are going to map our local resources—treasures that the system doesn't see.
> We are making a 'Treasure Map' of our area. I have divided it into three categories."

**Hang up a large template on the wall (or flipchart) with three columns:**

```
HANDS           |  PLACES          |  HEARTS
(What can people| (What is here?)  | (What are we passionate about?)
 do?)           |                  |
________________|__________________|__________________
                |                  |
                |                  |
                |                  |

```

### Column 1: HANDS (15 min)

> "First column: HANDS. What skills exist in this room? And not just 'I work as...' but also 'I can...'
> Examples:
> * Someone who can carpenter, sew, fix things?
> * Someone who can grow, bake, cook for many?
> * Someone who knows law, economics, writing?
> * Someone who can organize, coordinate, call people?
> 
> 
> Write on a post-it what YOU can do, and stick it up."

**Hand out post-its (yellow color).**

**Give 5 minutes.**

**Then:**

> "Okay, let's read through what we have. I'll read aloud, you listen."

**Read aloud all post-its while putting them up.**

**After review:**

> "WOW. Look at all the skills we have in this room! And this is just [X] people. Imagine 50 people, 100 people..."

### Column 2: PLACES (10 min)

> "Next column: PLACES. What physical resources do we have in our area?
> Examples:
> * Empty premises (basements, shops that closed)?
> * Garden land (allotments, yards, roof gardens)?
> * Gathering places (association rooms, churches, schools after closing)?
> * Common spaces (parking lots, parks, squares)?
> 
> 
> Even if you don't *own* the place—if it *exists*, it counts. Write it down!"

**Hand out post-its (blue color).**

**Give 5 minutes, read aloud, put up.**

> "Okay, so we actually have places. Maybe not all available yet, but they exist."

### Column 3: HEARTS (10 min)

> "Last column: HEARTS. What are you passionate about together? What would make your daily life better?
> Examples:
> * Children's safety on the way to school?
> * Better food, cheaper food?
> * Less loneliness among the elderly?
> * More greenery, nature?
> * Own energy?
> 
> 
> Nothing is too small or too big. Write it down!"

**Hand out post-its (pink color).**

**Give 5 minutes, read aloud, put up.**

> "Good! Now we see what we have and what we want. Next step: choose ONE thing."

---

## 40-60 min: Decision Making - What do we do?

**What you say:**

> "Now comes the hard part: choosing. We can't do everything at once. We must choose ONE thing we can do within 30 days.
> Why 30 days? Because if it takes longer, there is a risk it never happens.
> We use a method called 'dot-voting'. You get two votes each."

**Prepare flipchart with ideas from Meeting 3 + new ones from the hearts column.**

**Write up as options (example):**

1. Start food guild (directly from farmers)
2. Create neighborhood house (share tools)
3. Safety ring on WhatsApp
4. Energy cooperative (solar panels)
5. Walking bus for children to school
6. [Something they suggested themselves]

> "You get two stickers (or marks with a pen). Put them on what you think is most important. You can put both on the same thing if you really burn for it."

**Hand out stickers/markers.**

**Let everyone vote (5 min).**

**Count the votes.**

> "Okay! Most votes went to: [X]. Is everyone comfortable with us focusing on that? If anyone is *strongly* against, say so now."

**Give 30 seconds of silence for objections.**

**If no objections:**

> "Great! Then we go with [X]."

**If objection:**

> "Okay, [name], what is the problem with [X]?"
> [Listen. Try to find a compromise or choose number two on the list.]

---

## 60-75 min: Action Plan - Who does what, when?

**What you say:**

> "Now we have decided *what*. Now we need to decide *how*, *who*, and *when*. We fill in an action plan together."

**Hang up action plan template:**

```
OUR ACTION: [What we decided]

STEP 1: [First concrete step]
  WHO: [Name]
  WHEN: [Date]

STEP 2: [Next step]
  WHO: [Name]
  WHEN: [Date]

STEP 3: [Third step]
  WHO: [Name]
  WHEN: [Date]

NEXT MEETING: [Date in 30 days]
  WHERE: [Place]
  PURPOSE: Share what we learned

```

**Facilitate by asking:**

### For each step (15 min total):

**Step 1:**

> "Okay, if we are going to [food guild/neighborhood house/etc], what is the VERY first thing we must do? Not everything at once—just the first step."

[Example for food guild: "Find local farmers"]

> "Good. Who can do that? Who has time and interest?"

[Let someone volunteer. If no one: "Can we split it up? Maybe two people together?"]

> "When should it be done?"

[Set date—not "soon" but actual date.]

**Step 2 and 3: Same process.**

**Important:**

* Every step should have a NAME (not "someone" but actual person).
* Every step should have a DATE (not "within a few weeks").
* Steps should be CONCRETE (not "investigate possibilities" but "call three farmers").

## 75-80 min: 30-Day Contract - The Pledge

**What you say:**

> "Good job! Now we have a plan. But plans can be forgotten. So we are going to do something a little solemn: we are going to write a contract with each other.
> Not legally binding—just a promise to yourselves."

**Hand out pre-filled contract template (or write on flipchart):**

```
30-DAY CONTRACT

We, the participants of [Group Name or Place],
promise to execute the following before [Date in 30 days]:

[Our decided action]

We will return on [Date] at [Place]
to share what we have learned.

Signatures:
_______________________
_______________________
_______________________

```

> "I fill in what we decided. Then we go around and everyone who wants to can sign. If you don't want to sign, no pressure—but then you can't complain later!"

[Small laugh.]

**Let everyone sign.**

**Photograph the contract (for documentation).**

---

## 80-85 min: Next Steps + Continuation

**What you say:**

> "So! We have done it. From talking about problems to actually deciding on an action. That is big.
> What happens now? Three options:

**Option 1:** We meet in 30 days to share lessons, then we stop.

**Option 2:** We continue as a study circle and go deeper into [one of your systems].

**Option 3:** We become an active group that actually runs the [food guild/neighborhood house/etc] forward.

> You don't need to choose now. But think about it. And regardless of what: go to **svensksubsidiaritet.se** and share your experience. It helps other groups all over Sweden to learn from you.
> You are not alone. Thousands of Swedes are making the same journey. Your thoughts and actions become patterns that others can copy."

---

## 85-90 min: Closing Check-out + Celebration

**What you say:**

> "Last check-out. But this time you shall say two words:
> 1. How you feel now.
> 2. A thank you to someone else in the group.
> 
> 
> I’ll start: I feel... [hopeful]. And thank you to [name] for daring to share your skepticism—it made the conversation richer."

**Go one round.**

**After the last person:**

> "Thank you. Thank you for coming, four times. Thank you for sharing thoughts, doubts, hope. Thank you for choosing action instead of just words.
> The Swedish 'Folkhemmet' (People's Home) was not built in Stockholm. It was built in rooms exactly like this one. With coffee, silence, and stubborn people who said: *maybe there is another way*.
> You are part of something bigger now. Good luck with your 30 days. See you soon!"

**Extra fika! Celebrate yourselves.**

## Troubleshooting Meeting 4

**No one wants to take responsibility for steps:**

* "Okay, we can split it up. Can two people do it together? Easier that way."

**They choose something too big (like 'solving the housing crisis'):**

* "Very important goal! But for 30 days—what is the SMALLEST step towards that? Maybe: map empty premises, or invite the municipal councilor?"

**Discussion becomes too long:**

* "Good points! But we have 5 minutes left. Can we make the decision now and refine later?"

**Someone says 'this will never work':**

* "Fair to be skeptical. But can we test for 30 days? If it doesn't work, we have learned something. If it works, we have something amazing."

**They want to keep talking instead of acting:**

* "I hear you want to talk more. But talk rarely leads to change—action does. Can we decide ONE thing today?"
