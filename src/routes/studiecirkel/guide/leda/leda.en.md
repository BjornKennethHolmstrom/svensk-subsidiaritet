# **For the Circle Leader – The Art of Leading Swedes in Conversation**

## **Time Discipline (Swedish Punctuality is a Superpower)**

* **Start:** Exactly on the scheduled time (even if only two people have arrived).
* **The 90-Minute Rhythm:**
* 0-15 min: Check-in + coffee
* 15-40 min: Discussion
* 40-50 min: Exercise/Activity
* 50-85 min: Summary
* 85-90 min: Check-out + next steps


* **End:** Exactly on the scheduled time (people have babysitters, buses to catch).

## **Handling Classic Swedish Challenges**

### **1. "We already tried this in 1978..."**

* **Response:** "I hear that you have experience. Can you tell us what we can learn from that attempt so we don’t make the same mistakes?"
* **Transform:** From cynicism to experiential knowledge.

### **2. "But isn't that the law?"** (Rules mindset)

* **Response:** "Absolutely, and laws are important. But tonight, we get to play with the question: *If we could change one rule—which one would it be and why?*"
* **Transform:** From compliance to creativity.

### **3. Silence is not disinterest**

* Swedes think before they speak. Wait 7 seconds after a question.
* **Tip:** "Let's take 30 seconds of silent thinking time before we start sharing."

### **4. "I don’t have an opinion..."** (The Law of Jante/Jantelagen)

* **Solution:** Use **sticky notes**—everyone writes down thoughts first, then reads them out anonymously.
* **Phrase:** "There are no stupid answers, only different perspectives."

## **Four Roles You Play (And None are "The Expert")**

1. **The Timekeeper** – "We have 10 minutes left on this point."
2. **The Summarizer** – "So what I’m hearing is that several people are saying..."
3. **The Facilitator** – "Who haven’t we heard from yet?"
4. **The Connector** – "What Lars said about the school reminds me of what Anna said about healthcare..."

## **When It Gets Emotional**

* Swedes rarely get loud, but can become silent with anger/grief.
* **Phrase:** "This is an important topic that affects many. Let's take a break and drink some water."
* **Rule:** We discuss systems, not people. If someone mentions "Politician X" – "What system do you think creates incentives for Politician X to act that way?"

## **The Swedish Consensus Magic**

1. **First Round:** Everyone gets to say what they think without discussion.
2. **Second Round:** "What themes do you hear?"
3. **Third Round:** "Can we agree that X is a problem we want to address?"
4. **Conclusion:** "So our shared understanding tonight is..."
