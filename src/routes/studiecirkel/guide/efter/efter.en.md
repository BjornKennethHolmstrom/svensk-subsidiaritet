# **After the Circle – From Conversation to Community**

## **Closing Rituals (For the Swedish Soul)**

**The Final Meeting:**

1. **Review the "Treasure Map"** – see what resources you actually have.
2. **Choose ONE thing** to do within 30 days (small, concrete, possible).
3. **Write a "30-Day Contract"** on a paper that everyone signs.
4. **Set a date for "Meeting 5: Follow-up"** (if you want).
5. **Celebrate with extra fika** (could be semlor, punsch, something festive).

**30-Day Contract Template:**

> "We, the participants of [Group Name], promise that before [Date], we will do the following: [Concrete Action]. We will return on [Date] to share what we have learned. Signed: [Signatures]"

## **Options for Continued Engagement**

### **Option 1: Continue as a Study Circle**

* **Theme:** "Subsidiarity for [your city/district]"
* **Focus:** Go deeper into one area (food, energy, care).
* **Resource:** Request special material from svensksubsidiaritet.se

### **Option 2: Start a Practical Project**

* **Food:** Buying club, allotment garden community, "eat together" evenings.
* **Energy:** Solar panel group-buy, energy savings club.
* **Safety:** Neighborhood watch ring on WhatsApp, "walking bus" for children.
* **Support:** Pattern library at svensksubsidiaritet.se

### **Option 3: Become Ambassadors**

* Invite the municipal councilor/regional politicians to a meeting.
* Write a letter to the editor in the local newspaper.
* Start a circle in the next neighborhood/workplace.

## **How to Share Your Learning (So Others Can Grow)**

1. **Go to svensksubsidiaritet.se**
2. **Click "Share your circle's experience"**
3. **Fill in a short form:**
* Which area are you from?
* Which system did you focus on?
* What worked well?
* What would you do differently?
* Which action did you choose?



**Why this is important:** Your experiences become **patterns** in our library. The next group in Kiruna or Malmö can learn from you.

## **When It Feels Too Big...**

**Remember:**

1. **No one expects you to solve the housing crisis.** A neighborhood cooperation around potatoes is a revolution on its own small scale.
2. **Silence is okay.** The group might sleep for a while and wake up in the spring.
3. **You are not alone.** Thousands of other Swedes have the same questions. Your thoughts feed a larger movement.

## **The Final Word (To You as Circle Leader)**

Thank you. You have done something brave—you have said "maybe there is another way" and created a space for others to explore that together.

Regardless of what happens now: You have planted a seed. It might sprout immediately. It might lie in the soil over the winter. But you have broken the ice.

**The Swedish "Folkhemmet" (People's Home) was not built in Stockholm. It was built in rooms exactly like this one, with coffee, silence, and the stubborn belief that doing things together is better.**
