# **Before You Start – A Guide to Hosting**

## **How to invite (without sounding like a cult)**

**SMS/Email Template:**

> "Hi [Name]! I’m gathering a few neighbors/colleagues to talk about how we can make our daily lives better—not by complaining, but by thinking differently about how society functions. There will be fika, good company, and no requirements to 'believe in' anything specific. Interested in giving it a try? 📅 [Date] at [Time] at [Location]. Let me know if you want to join!"

**How to answer common questions:**

* *"Is this politics?"* – "No, it’s about understanding systems, not parties."
* *"What does it cost?"* – "Nothing, except maybe bringing some fika to share."
* *"I don’t know anything about this..."* – "Perfect! Then you have no preconceived notions."

## **Room Prep (The Swedish Magic)**

1. **Chairs in a circle** – no head of the table, no back row.
2. **Fika station** – coffee, tea, something to munch on (shared responsibility works well).
3. **Tools** – flipchart/paper, pens, sticky notes, and **a silence button** (can be a bell or just "raising a hand").
4. **The Temperature** – Swedes function best at 20-22°C, not too hot.

## **Your First Five Minutes (Exactly What to Say)**

> "Welcome everyone. Thank you for coming.
> I’ve invited you here because I believe we need to start talking in a new way about what isn't working in our daily lives. Not by complaining about individuals or political parties, but by looking at the *systems*—how decision-making works, where knowledge is located, and how we can become more self-sufficient right here where we live.
> I don’t have the answers. But I have some good questions that I think can lead us somewhere new. And I have coffee.
> We will meet four times. Today, we start by simply noting what feels off. Next time, we will learn a tool for analysis. The third time, we look at solutions. The fourth time, we decide on something small that we can actually do.
> The only thing required of you is that you listen and share what you feel comfortable sharing. No one will get homework or be interrogated.
> Shall we start by everyone saying their name and one word about how it feels to be here tonight?"
