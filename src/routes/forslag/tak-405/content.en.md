# The Region's Nervous System

*TAK-405: Pilot study for psychological preparedness and public health in public transport.*

## 1. Strategic Direction: Total Defense 2.0

In accordance with the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency's (MSB) regulations on civil defense (2024:1032), psychological resilience is a critical component of total defense. A population characterized by chronic stress and cognitive exhaustion has a poorer ability to resist disinformation and crises.

This proposal aims to use Region Stockholm's infrastructure to create **"Cognitive Shelters" (Psychological Safe Spaces)** in everyday life — and thereby test whether total defense doctrines actually work under peacetime conditions. If we cannot maintain psychological resilience under normal commuting conditions, how will we manage real crises?

By seeking external funding (MSB/EU), we bypass the internal budgetary conflict between traffic and healthcare. Stockholm thereby becomes the **first capital in the world** to integrate civil defense psychology directly into the design of public transport.

## 2. Proposal for Pilot Project (Externally Funded)

We propose four delimited sub-projects that do not burden the ordinary operating budget or capacity during rush hour.

### Pilot A: "The Rest Carriage" (North)

**Route:** Roslagsbanan (Östra station – Åkersberga/Vallentuna).

* **Time:** Off-peak only (09:00–15:00 and after 19:00). No impact on capacity during rush hour.
* **Concept:** "Digital-free zone". Passive design (subdued lighting, no advertising, natural sounds) encourages rest.
* **Social Infrastructure:** One seat is marked "Priority for those needing rest" (equivalent to disability seats, but for mental recovery). This creates social legitimacy without coercion.
* **Work Environment:** *Self-enforcing design.* No active monitoring by staff is required. Passengers are informed via clear signage ("Thank you for resting").

### Pilot B: "The Recovery Line" (South/Järva)

**Route:** Trunk bus 172/173 (Skärholmen–Fruängen–Högdalen) or Blue Line (Järva).

* **Purpose:** Health equity. To offer the same quality of recovery for commuters in the outer suburbs as for office commuters in the inner city.
* **Concept:** "Biophilic Bus". A bus in regular service is equipped with green elements, sound insulation, and circadian lighting for shift workers.
* **Requirement:** Simultaneous launch with Pilot A is absolutely necessary for project start. Data is collected comparatively between the districts.

### Pilot C: "Wellness Points" (Digital Innovation)

**Concept:** Integration between the SL app and pedometers.

* **Mechanism:** Travelers who reduce congestion by walking the last stop are rewarded with points (cultural discounts, wellness credits).
* **Benefit:** Relieves the system ("Peak Shaving") without infrastructure investments.

### Pilot D: "Strategic Transfer Buffers" (The 7-Minute Rule)

**Concept:** Planned optimization of waiting time at major transfer points (e.g., when changing from train to connecting bus).

* **Mechanism:** On selected departures during off-peak hours, a transfer time of **7–8 minutes** is scheduled instead of a stressful 3–4 minutes.
* **Purpose:** Research on *Heart Rate Variability (HRV)* shows that the parasympathetic nervous system (recovery) is activated only after approx. 7 minutes of stillness. By "forcing" a slightly longer pause, a window for biological recovery is created.
* **Traffic Benefit:** The extra time simultaneously functions as a **punctuality buffer** (resilience), ensuring connections even with minor delays. We transform "delay" into "planned recovery".
* **Cost:** Zero (software adjustment). Perfect for A/B testing of stress levels.

## 3. Academic Knowledge Platform

The project is established as an **open research platform** where Karolinska Institutet (KI), KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Stockholm University (SU) can use anonymized data for theses and publications. This provides:

* Free high-quality analysis from students and researchers
* Academic constituencies that defend the project politically
* International publications that strengthen Stockholm's profile
* Opportunity for EU funding via Horizon programs

## 4. Funding Model: Budget-Neutral Through External Funding

To avoid cross-subsidization between committees, the following funding is proposed:

| Source | Purpose | Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MSB (Psychological Defense)** | Resilience and cognitive preparedness in civil infrastructure | 40% |
| **EU (Wellbeing Economy Initiative)** | Interreg/Horizon support for cross-sectoral innovation | 40% |
| **Innovation Fund (The Region)** | Co-financing of technical development and evaluation | 15% |
| **Potential Knowledge Partners** | Insurance companies (Folksam, Länsförsäkringar) get access to anonymized preventive health data | 5% |

> **Note:** No redistribution from the ordinary traffic budget is required. The project is run as an independent innovation pilot with full external funding.

## 5. Risk Analysis and Measures

**Capacity and Punctuality**
*Risk:* That "The Rest Carriage" reduces capacity.
*Measure:* The pilot runs only during off-peak hours. At high occupancy (>80%), "Rest Status" automatically ceases and the carriage functions as usual. No risk of platform chaos.

**Work Environment (SEKO/Safety Representatives)**
*Risk:* That train attendants are forced to act as "silence police".
*Measure:* The design principle is **Nudging**, not Prohibition. The environment (light, sound, color) signals the behavior. Staff have no instruction to intervene against those using mobile phones, which eliminates the threat scenario. Early consultation with the trade union SEKO during the design phase.

**Equality**
*Risk:* That the initiative is seen as targeted only at resource-strong groups.
*Measure:* Simultaneous launch in South/Järva (Pilot B) is an absolute requirement for project start. Data is collected comparatively between the districts to ensure equitable effect.

**Measurable Results**
*Risk:* What happens if the pilot does not show a measurable effect?
*Measure:* Even null results would be valuable, as they would inform future infrastructure psychology investments and prevent larger misallocation of resources. Transparency regarding results — positive as well as negative — strengthens credibility and enables evidence-based policy.

## 6. International Positioning

While Luxembourg (free trains with "Zen Zones"), Helsinki ("Mieli Metro"), and Tokyo (JR East "Forest Carriage") have tested individual elements, Stockholm would become the **first capital to systematically integrate civil defense psychology into the everyday design of public transport**.

This positions Region Stockholm for UNESCO Creative Cities recognition, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group profiling, WHO Healthy Cities Network leadership, and EU Wellbeing Economy lighthouse project status.

## 7. Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preparation | 3 months | Applications (MSB, EU), design, consultation with SEKO and safety representatives |
| Pilot | 12 months | All four pilots run in parallel with continuous data collection |
| Evaluation | 6 months | Analysis (academic + internal), reporting, recommendations |

## 8. Conclusion

Region Stockholm has the chance to be the first in the world to integrate **civil preparedness** directly into the design of public transport — and thereby test whether Sweden's total defense doctrine actually works in practice.

By financing this externally and limiting it to off-peak hours and innovation budgets, we create a "risk-free sandbox" where we can test whether infrastructure can build health, not just consume it.

This is not just a traffic project. It is a test of whether Swedish administration can think systemically enough to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
