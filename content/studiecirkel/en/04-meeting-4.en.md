# Meeting 4: From Words to Action

## Introduction
We have complained, we have analyzed, we have dreamed.
Now we must do something.

## Mapping: Our Assets (40 min)
We are going to create a "Treasure Map" of our area. Fill in:

* **Hands:** Who can build? Who can grow food? Who knows the law?
* **Places:** Is there an empty room? A basement? A plot of land?
* **Hearts:** What do we care about collectively? (The children's safety? The food?)

## Decision
Choose **ONE** small thing you can do within 30 days.
* *Example:* "Start a buying club for potatoes."
* *Example:* "Invite the municipal councilor to a meeting about the Compass."

## Closing
Thank you for daring to think differently.
