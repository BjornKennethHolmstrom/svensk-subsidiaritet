# Five Structural Problems. Five Mechanisms. Zero Extra Cost.

Sweden has the world's most sophisticated public systems. They are professionally led, generously funded — and they produce results that contradict their own goals.

This is not an ideological critique. It is a technical diagnosis. And for every problem, there is a mechanism that aligns incentives correctly, without costing more.

## The Problems We All See But No One Solves

### The Nurse Who Cannot Live in Her Own Municipality

Upplands Väsby needs nurses, teachers, and police officers. But a newly built two-room apartment costs 4.5 million SEK. The municipality *wants* to build cheaper housing, but the Planning and Building Act prohibits requirements on tenure form in the detailed development plan. Developers need a 15–20% margin to make the project viable. Current residents worry about densification.

Three interests locking each other out. None of them is unreasonable. All together make the solution impossible — with current tools.

**→ Mechanism: Density as Currency.** The municipality offers bonus building rights (+20% Gross Floor Area). The condition: the land for the bonus area falls to a Community Land Trust. The developer gets their calculation, the municipality gets long-term price-stable housing, existing residents get neighbors who contribute to safety through self-management. No tax subsidies. Civil law agreement, not PBA requirement.

### 30% of Everyone Over 75 is Lonely Every Day

Loneliness increases mortality by 26% — as harmful as 15 cigarettes a day. At the same time, 40% of young people aged 16–29 lack meaningful ways to contribute to their local community. Association participation has decreased by 22% since 2010.

This is not a care gap — professional care should continue as before. It is a *public health gap*: the need for daily social contact that lies outside statutory responsibility. The municipality cannot hire its way out of the loneliness epidemic.

**→ Mechanism: Neighborhood Points.** A platform where voluntary "silver lining" activities (game partner, language café, walking buddy) are rewarded with points that are redeemed for underutilized municipal capacity during off-peak hours — swimming pools, theater tickets, culture houses. Never for statutory interventions. Never in competition with employed staff. Union approved before pilot.

### If the Baltic Sea is Blocked — Who Manages the Forest in Norrbotten?

Value is created locally: wind power, mines, forest, food. But profit is taxed centrally. Resource-rich municipalities go bankrupt while Stockholm grows. "Brain drain" has created a critical skills shortage in the regions that produce our electricity and our food. In a crisis, we lack the decentralized workforce required.

The countryside is not a cost. It is our backup generator. And we are in the process of shutting it down.

**→ Mechanism: Regional Tax Swap.** Reduced employer contributions in sparsely populated areas, financed through increased property tax on non-movable assets (wind turbines, mines, hydropower). Plus: technology-neutral connectivity guarantee via total defense, and a voluntary rural service for young people linking crisis preparedness to shortage occupations. Budget-neutral at full implementation.

### Why Do Swedes Start Half as Many Companies as Danes?

Not because we lack ideas. Because our social safety net punishes risk-taking. Anyone leaving employment to start a company loses unemployment benefits. Anyone who fails lacks a soft landing. Effective marginal tax rate when transitioning from income support to part-time work: 60–80%. The system designed to protect us *traps* us.

Economic insecurity increases cortisol by 40–60% and impairs cognitive function equivalent to 13 IQ points. We are already paying — in healthcare costs, production loss, and untapped potential.

**→ Mechanism: Transition Guarantee.** Separate basic security (everyone) from income insurance (via unemployment funds). 12,200 SEK/month guaranteed basic level, independent of life situation. Tapering 60 öre per earned krona instead of binary thresholds. Qualification condition: 5 years for non-citizens. Pilot activity in selected municipalities before national rollout. Estimated net effect: budget-neutral through reduced administration and better health outcomes.

### We Talk About Psychological Defense — But Commuters Are Already Exhausted

MSB's regulations on civil defense require psychological resilience. But a population characterized by chronic stress and cognitive exhaustion has a poorer ability to resist disinformation and crises. We plan for war but ignore that everyday life is already breaking down our cognitive resilience.

**→ Mechanism: Cognitive Shelters in Public Transport.** The "Rest Carriage" on Roslagsbanan during off-peak hours — digital-free zone with subdued stimulation. "Safety Stops" with sound design at bus lines in vulnerable areas. Nothing that burdens the operating budget — externally financed via MSB/EU as total defense testing in peacetime.

## The Pattern

These five proposals look different. But they all do the same thing.

Each proposal identifies a place where the system's **stated goal** and its **actual incentives** point in opposite directions — and offers a mechanism that reverses the incentives without requiring more resources.

| Problem | System's Goal | System's Actual Incentive | The Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Housing | Cheap housing for all | Maximize price per m² | Trade density for CLT land |
| Loneliness | Social cohesion | Cheaper to isolate | Create currency for contact |
| Countryside | The whole of Sweden should live | Extract value, export people | Tax what stays |
| Security | Protect against risk | Trap in passivity | Separate floor and insurance |
| Resilience | Psychological defense | Ignore everyday stress | Use existing infrastructure |

These are not five separate problems. It is **one pattern**: Swedish systems working against their own goals. And it does not require more money to solve — it requires better design.
