# Systems Thinking in 60 Minutes

*An introductory lesson for all upper secondary school programs*

**Target Audience:** Years 1-3, all programs
**Time:** 60 minutes
**Subjects:** Social Studies, Science Studies, History, Religion, Mathematics (adaptable)
**Prerequisites:** None

---

## Lesson Objectives

After the lesson, the student should:

* Be able to give an example of a system in their everyday life
* Understand that systems can create problems not caused by any single individual
* Have tools to see "decision distance" and "feedback" in their surroundings

## Lesson Structure (60 min)

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 0-5 | Intro: "Who decides on your lunch?" |
| 5-20 | Group Exercise: Mapping an everyday system |
| 20-30 | Concepts: Systems, feedback, decision distance |
| 30-45 | Application: Analyzing a new situation |
| 45-55 | Discussion: What does this mean for us? |
| 55-60 | Conclusion + tools for further work |

---

## 0-5 min: Intro – "Who decides on your lunch?"

**The teacher asks:**

> "Think about school lunch. Who decides what is served?"

Students guess:

* The kitchen staff?
* The principal?
* The municipality?
* The state?

**The point:** Most people don't know. Decisions are made far away, by people they have never met.

> "Today we are going to learn a tool to see invisible structures like this."

---

## 5-20 min: Group Exercise – Mapping lunch as a system

**Instruction (on the board or big screen):**

> "Draw a system that shows why you get the food you get. Include:
> * People who influence
> * Money
> * Rules
> * Suppliers
> * Decisions
> 
> 

> Draw arrows between the parts. Show who influences whom."

**Materials:** Large paper, pens (colored pens if possible)

**The teacher circulates** and supports with questions:

* Who decides the budget?
* Who decides the menu?
* Who decides the portion size?
* Who decides where the food is purchased?

---

## 20-30 min: Concept Introduction

**The teacher gathers the class and points to examples from their maps:**

**System** = parts that are connected and influence each other

* Show a map: "Here we see that budget influences menu, menu influences purchasing, purchasing influences quality..."

**Feedback** = when the result of an event influences the cause.
Examples

* (Politics) "If the food is bad, students complain. If students complain, politicians change the budget next year."
* (Nature) Ice melts → Dark water → More heat absorbed → More ice melts. (No one "decides", it just happens).

**Decision Distance** = how many steps between the problem and the person deciding

* Example: "Students see the problem every day. Politicians see it once a month on a piece of paper."

## 30-45 min: Application – Analyzing a new situation

**Students receive (in the same groups) a new case to analyze:**

Choose a case that fits the subject:

| Subject | Case |
| --- | --- |
| Social Studies | Why is it difficult to build rental apartments in your municipality? |
| Science Studies | Why does eutrophication in the Baltic Sea continue despite measures? |
| History | Why could World War I start from a single assassination? |
| Religion | Why do religious communities split internally? |
| Mathematics | Why do rumors spread so quickly on social media? |

**Questions to answer:**

1. Who are the actors? (Draw a simple map)
2. Where is the decision distance?
3. Are there feedbacks that reinforce or dampen the problem?

---

## 45-55 min: Discussion – What does this mean?

**The teacher leads a whole-class discussion:**

* "What happens when the decision distance is large?"
* "Can a problem exist without any single person being the villain?"
* "How could you use this tool in your other courses?"

**The Goal:** Students begin to see that many societal problems are *system failures*, not just *individual failures*.

---

## 55-60 min: Conclusion + Tools

**Summary:**

> "Today you have learned:
> * To see systems in everyday life
> * To identify decision distance
> * To discover feedback loops
> 
> 

> This is the foundation of **systems thinking**. It is a tool for understanding why complex problems rarely have simple solutions."

**Tools for further work:**

> "If you want to explore more:
> * [svensksubsidiaritet.se/verktyg/kompass](https://svensksubsidiaritet.se/verktyg/kompass) – measure decision distance in your municipality
> * [svensksubsidiaritet.se/verktyg/maktanalys](https://svensksubsidiaritet.se/verktyg/maktanalys) – map who decides
> * [svensksubsidiaritet.se/studiecirkel](https://svensksubsidiaritet.se/studiecirkel) – in-depth study in groups
> 
> 

> Feel free to ask your teacher in [Social Studies/Science/History] if you want to do a longer module later."

## For the Teacher: Cheat Sheet

### Goal of the lesson (for you as a teacher)

This lesson is designed to:

* Arouse curiosity about *structures* rather than *individual actors*
* Give students a simple tool they can use immediately
* Create a bridge to in-depth study (the 6-week module) if interest exists

### Adaptations

**If time is short (30 min):**

* Only do the lunch exercise + concepts
* Skip the application cases

**If the class is weak in English/Swedish:**

* Use visual support
* Let students draw instead of write

**If the class wants more challenge:**

* Ask them to identify at least two feedback loops
* Ask them to propose a system change (not just point out problems)

### Common Questions

**"This sounds like leftist politics."**
Systems thinking is not ideological. It is used by everyone who wants to understand complex phenomena – from military strategy to business management to ecology. It does not question values, only our ability to see wholes.

**"I don't know enough about systems theory."**
You don't need to be an expert. Students learn by doing, not by listening to you. Your role is to ask questions, not to have answers.

**"My class is rowdy, this won't work."**
Start with the lunch question. Everyone has an opinion about food. It is a low-threshold entry that usually engages even the otherwise quiet ones.

* What worked well?
* Where did students get stuck?
* Would you like to do a longer module (6 weeks) with this class?
