# PROPOSAL FOR SYSTEMIC HOUSING STRATEGY

**Project Name:** TAK-404 (The Väsby Model)
**Date:** 2025-12-03
**To:** The Building Committee & The City Planning Administration, Upplands Väsby Municipality
**From:** Björn Kenneth Holmström, systems thinker and Väsby resident

## 1. Executive Summary

Upplands Väsby, like many municipalities in the Stockholm region, faces an "impossible triangle" within housing policy:

1. **The need for new construction** (to meet the housing shortage).
2. **The requirement for profitability** (so that developers want to build).
3. **The need for affordable prices** (so that ordinary wage earners can afford to stay).

This memorandum presents a new model – **"The Housing Circle"** – that resolves this knot by using civil law land allocation agreements, innovative incentives for developers ("Density as Currency"), and Community Land Trust mechanisms.

The proposal is developed through a **SCI analysis** (Synthesis, Challenge, Integration) to ensure technical feasibility against the Planning and Building Act (PBL).

## 2. Current Situation Analysis (Synthesis)

We see three competing interests locking the market:

* **The Developer:** Needs a 15–20% project margin. With today's land prices and construction costs, high rents/condo prices are required for the calculation to add up.
* **The Municipality:** Wants social mixing and vibrant neighborhoods, but has limited tools in the detailed development plan to force "cheap" housing.
* **Current Residents:** Are skeptical of densification perceived as threatening the area's character or lowering property values.

**Conclusion:** We cannot solve this with "more of the same". We need a new type of contract.

## 3. Identified Obstacles & Risk Analysis (Challenge)

Before the solution is presented, we must acknowledge the structural obstacles. Naive idealism falls flat against these realities:

**A. "The Economic Wall" (Profitability)**

* *Obstacle:* Building with high sustainability and social requirements is expensive. If the municipality sets requirements too high in the land allocation, no developer will submit a bid.
* *Risk:* Land allocations remain unbuilt.

**B. "The Legal Wall" (PBL & The Local Government Act)**

* *Obstacle:* The municipality cannot require a specific form of tenure (e.g., "cheap rental apartments") in the detailed development plan. This conflicts with the Planning and Building Act.
* *Risk:* Decisions are appealed and overturned.

**C. "The Local Resistance" (Public Opinion)**

* *Obstacle:* Homeowners and tenant-owner associations worry that "social housing" will lead to insecurity or lowered values.
* *Risk:* Political backlash and stopped projects.

## 4. The Solution: Integrated Mechanisms

The proposal addresses the above obstacles through three specific mechanisms.

### Mechanism 1: Density as Currency (Solves Profitability)

We cannot force developers to lower their profit margin. But we can increase the value of the project.

* **Proposal:** The municipality offers a **"Bonus Building Right"** (e.g., +20% Gross Floor Area or an extra floor) in the detailed development plan.
* **The Condition:** This bonus is triggered *only* if the developer signs a civil law agreement to transfer the land for the bonus area to a **Community Land Trust (CLT)**.
* **Effect:** The developer gets their calculation to add up through increased volume on the market-rate housing. The municipality gets "social housing" (The Housing Circle) without subsidizing with tax funds.

### Mechanism 2: Civil Law Governance (Solves Legality)

Since the PBL is blunt, we move the requirements to the private law agreement between the municipality and the developer at the land sale.

* **Proposal:** The land allocation agreement contains clauses on **"Key Person Housing"**.
* **Model:** A share of the housing is reserved for community-critical professions (nurses, teachers, police officers) who work in Väsby but cannot afford to live here.
* **Legality:** This is fully possible to agree upon under civil law at land sale, which circumvents the limitations in the detailed planning instrument.

### Mechanism 3: Neighborhood Contract (Solves Public Opinion)

We reframe "Social Mix" from charity to security.

* **Proposal:** The residents in "The Housing Circle" (the CLT houses) sign a **Residency Contract with Social Commitments**.
* **Content:** The rent is reduced in exchange for verifiable work in the area (homework help, night walking, park maintenance).
* **Effect:** The new neighbors become a resource that *increases* security and well-being in the area, which protects property values for existing homeowners. It is not "welfare housing"; it is "functional housing".

---

## 5. Recommended Roadmap (Pilot)

We do not propose overhauling the entire housing policy overnight. We propose a **Sharp Pilot Project**.

**Phase 1: Land Allocation Competition (Q3 2026)**

* Select a smaller, municipally owned plot (e.g., an "impossible" residual area or densification gap).
* Announce competition: "Who can deliver the best social commitments in exchange for more flexible building rights?"

**Phase 2: Establishment of Väsby CLT (Q4 2026)**

* The municipality helps to facilitate (but does not own) the formation of a non-profit land foundation (CLT) that can receive the land.

**Phase 3: Construction Start & Evaluation (2027)**

* The project is implemented. The outcome is measured not only in completed apartments, but in "retention of key competence" (how many teachers could afford to stay?).

## 6. Conclusion

This proposal is not an ideological wish list, but a technical solution to a systemic error.

By using the land allocation agreement as a strategic tool, Upplands Väsby can lead the way and show that it is possible to build both profitably and socially sustainably.

This document is submitted as an **open basis** (Open Source) to the municipality. The models and logic are free to use, adapt, and implement to solve the housing knot.

The challenge – and the opportunity – now lies with you.
