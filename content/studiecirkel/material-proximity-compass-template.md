## The Three Corners

### 1. POWER (Where are decisions made?)

**Scale:** Central (Stockholm/EU) ←→ Local (here)

- Who decides the budget?
- Who decides the rules?
- At which level are decisions made?

**Mark:** Central ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐ Local

---

### 2. KNOWLEDGE (Whose expertise counts?)

**Scale:** Expert (certificate) ←→ Local (experience)

- Whose knowledge does the system listen to?
- Whose voice doesn't count?
- What type of knowledge is required?

**Mark:** Expert ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐ Local

---

### 3. RESILIENCE (How fragile is the system?)

**Scale:** Fragile (one solution) ←→ Robust (many solutions)

- If this stops working, what happens?
- Are there alternatives?
- How dependent are we?

**Mark:** Fragile ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐ Robust

## What Does the Shape Tell You?

**Analyze your compass:**

- **Pointed upward** = Centralized (power is far away, expert knowledge dominates, system is fragile)

- **Broad downward** = Local/distributed (power is near, local knowledge counts, many alternatives exist)
