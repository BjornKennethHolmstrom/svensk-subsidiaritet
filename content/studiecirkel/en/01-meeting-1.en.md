# Meeting 1: The Swedish Paradox

> *"We have built the world's most efficient systems, but we lost the human being in the process."*

## Introduction (15 min)
Sweden is world-renowned for its systems: Healthcare, Education, Welfare. But in recent years, something has shifted. Queues are growing. Staff are burning out. Rural areas are emptying.

Tonight, we will discuss why **centralization**—which worked so well in the 20th century—has become our biggest problem in the 21st century.

## Reading (10 min)
*Reading aloud from "Manifesto for Distributed Systems Literacy" (Part 1).*

**Key Concepts:**
* **Monoculture:** Doing the same thing everywhere (efficient but fragile).
* **Complexity:** When problems are unique and changing (requires local solutions).

## Discussion Questions (45 min)
1.  Where do you encounter "The System" in your daily life? (Social Insurance, Health Centers, Schools?)
2.  Do you feel that the decisions affecting you are made close by or far away?
3.  Can you give an example of when a "standard solution" did not fit your unique situation?

## Homework
For next time: Bring an example of a local resource (a person, a place, or a skill) that the system "misses" or fails to value.
