# Meeting 3: What is Subsidiarity?

## The Concept
**Subsidiarity** is a complicated word for a simple idea:
*"No power should be higher up than necessary."*

Or in plain English: **Local Governance.**

## Examples of Local Governance
Discuss these examples. Are they possible here?

1.  **Food Guilds:** Instead of just shopping at the supermarket, 50 neighbors combine purchasing power to buy directly from a farmer.
2.  **Neighborhood Houses:** Instead of everyone owning their own drill and lawnmower, the block has a shared tool library.
3.  **Safety Circles:** Neighbors with a WhatsApp group walking evening rounds are more effective than a police car passing once a week.

## Discussion (45 min)
* Which of these examples feels most appealing?
* Why aren't we doing this already? (Is it laws that stop us, or just habit?)
* "Lagom" (Just Right) is Swedish. How do we find the balance between state security and local freedom?
