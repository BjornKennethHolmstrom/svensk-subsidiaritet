# Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)
## Cognitive Infrastructure for a Distributed Society

### Why a Subsidiarity Site Is Talking About Basic Income

This page is not primarily about money. It is about a bottleneck.

Swedish Subsidiarity's system analyses consistently reveal the same pattern: Sweden is overcentralized, and this makes the system blind to the problems it tries to solve. The solution — subsidiarity, decisions close to those affected — requires citizens with the capacity to think, engage, and take local responsibility.

But capacity requires bandwidth. And bandwidth requires security.

Research by Mullainathan and Shafir shows that economic insecurity reduces functional cognitive capacity by the equivalent of 13 IQ points. The brain runs a constant background process — *"how will I pay rent?"* — that consumes resources from everything else. This is not about intelligence. It is about the fact that survival mode and systems thinking cannot run simultaneously.

Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) is one proposal for breaking that link. It is not the only possible solution, but it is the one we analyze here.

### What Is AUBI?

AUBI differs from standard UBI (Universal Basic Income) in three ways:

**1. Adaptive — not flat.**
Everyone receives an unconditional base amount (proposed at 15,000 SEK/month, adjusted for inflation and local living costs). Beyond this, needs-based supplements exist for those with illness, disability, care responsibilities, or other documented needs. The system recognizes that equal treatment is not the same as equitable treatment.

**2. Care-valuing.**
AUBI includes a mechanism for making visible and rewarding work that the market fails to capture: parenting, eldercare, neighborhood cooperation, ecological restoration, mentorship, cultural preservation. Not through a centralized scoring factory, but through locally validated contributions — a direct application of the subsidiarity principle.

**3. Systemically designed.**
AUBI does not merely replace existing benefit systems — it changes the incentive architecture. When basic security is guaranteed, no one needs to fake illness to survive, no one locks themselves into a destructive job, and no one abstains from local engagement due to lack of time.

### The Systemic Argument: Why Security Is Infrastructure

AUBI is typically framed in public debate as a distributional question — left versus right, solidarity versus work incentives. But there is a deeper argument that is not about ideology but about system architecture.

**Ashby's Law** (the Law of Requisite Variety) states that a system must be at least as complex as the problems it attempts to manage. A centralized Sweden with a stressed population running at 10 percent of its cognitive capacity has too little variety to meet the polycrisis — climate, demographics, digitalization, trust erosion.

From this perspective, AUBI is not "welfare." It is a **variety generator**. By freeing cognitive bandwidth for millions of citizens, it increases society's collective problem-solving capacity. More people can experiment, engage locally, start cooperatives, develop care solutions, contribute to open source, transition food production — exactly what subsidiarity needs in order to function.

Or put differently: subsidiarity is the hardware. AUBI is the electricity. Without power, the architecture remains empty.

### How Could It Be Financed?

A common objection. Here is an overview of the financing pathways discussed in research and policy proposals:

**Restructuring existing systems.** AUBI can replace basic unemployment benefits, social assistance, and portions of housing allowances. The administrative savings from a simplified system are significant — today's means-testing costs billions in processing, enforcement, and appeals.

**New tax bases.** Automation taxes (productivity gains from AI and robotics), expanded land value taxation, data exploitation taxes, and financial transaction taxes. These tax value that is currently extracted without being returned to society.

**Indirect savings.** Reduced crime, improved public health (chronic stress is the primary driver of inflammation-related disease), increased entrepreneurship, and local economic activity. These effects are difficult to price precisely but consistently documented across basic income experiments worldwide.

**An honest note:** full implementation of AUBI at 15,000 SEK base for all adults is an enormous expenditure (gross approximately 1,440 billion SEK/year). The net cost is substantially lower after taxation and system replacement, but it still requires a fundamental restructuring of the tax base. A responsible path forward runs through pilot programs, evidence-based scaling, and broad political anchoring — not overnight implementation.

### What Does the Research Say?

Basic income experiments conducted in Finland, Kenya, Canada, India, and the US consistently show:

**Labor supply is minimally affected.** Recipients do not stop working — but they switch to more meaningful work, start businesses, pursue education, or increase their care work.

**Health improves measurably.** Especially mental health, but also physical health through reduced stress, better nutrition, and more time for exercise and recovery.

**Crime decreases.** By eliminating desperation, strengthening the social fabric, and offering legitimate alternatives to illegal income.

**Entrepreneurship increases.** Basic security enables risk-taking — daring to start something new requires that failure does not mean catastrophe.

What research *cannot* yet answer is what happens at national scale, over decades, with adaptive (not flat) amounts. This requires large-scale pilot programs — and that argument cuts both ways: we do not know for certain it works, but we do not know it does not. Choosing not to experiment is also a choice.

### Challenges and Risks — Honestly

AUBI is not a magic wand. Here are the most serious objections, taken seriously:

**Inflation risk.** If everyone gets more money without increased production, prices rise. The counterargument: AUBI primarily redistributes existing resources rather than creating new ones, and the adaptive structure dampens inflationary pressure. But the risk requires continuous monitoring and adjustment mechanisms.

**Administrative complexity.** "Adaptive" means needs assessment — and needs assessment means bureaucracy. Without care, you recreate exactly the system you tried to replace. The solution lies in keeping the base amount entirely unconditional and limiting needs assessment to supplements, with transparent criteria and local validation.

**Care currency design challenge.** Rewarding care without creating a new control bureaucracy or enabling systematic fraud requires thoughtful design. Who defines "care"? Who validates? Local solutions (study circles, neighborhood councils, municipal panels) are more credible than central agencies, but create their own risks around favoritism and arbitrariness.

**Cultural resistance.** "People should earn their keep" is a deeply rooted norm. AUBI challenges it — not by saying work does not matter, but by widening the definition of what *counts* as work. That shift takes time and requires a new narrative, not just a new policy.

**The passivity risk.** Not everyone who receives freedom uses it productively. Research shows most do, but not all. The question is whether that is a reason to deny everyone freedom — or a reason to complement AUBI with support structures, mentorship, and meaningful local engagement opportunities.

### AUBI in the Swedish Context

Sweden has unique preconditions:

**High digital maturity.** BankID, Swish, and the Swedish Tax Agency's infrastructure make automated payments technically trivial compared to most countries.

**Strong associational tradition.** The folkrörelser (popular movements, weakened but not dead) constitute natural platforms for the local validation of care contributions that AUBI requires.

**Already extensive welfare state.** The transition is not about building from zero but about simplifying and restructuring existing systems.

**Demographic challenge.** An aging population requires more care with fewer formal caregivers. AUBI makes informal care visible and supported instead of treating it as invisible.

But Sweden also has specific obstacles: an equalization system that breaks the link between local decisions and local consequences, a professionalized welfare culture that mistrusts non-credentialed knowledge, and a consensus tradition that makes systemic critique harder to voice.

### What We Propose

Not a revolution. An experiment.

**Step 1:** Three to five municipalities with varying conditions (city, mid-size, rural) conduct three-year pilot programs with AUBI base payments. The design should be open and the evaluation independent.

**Step 2:** In parallel, measurement tools are developed (including through the GSI framework) to track not only economic but systemic effects: trust, local engagement, cognitive capacity, visibility of care work, crime, health.

**Step 3:** Based on evidence, gradual scaling — or an honest accounting of what did not work and why.

### Contribute to the Discussion

AUBI is not finished. It is a hypothesis that needs testing, challenging, and improvement.

We invite you to participate — regardless of whether you believe it is possible or impossible. Systems thinking requires that we examine ideas rigorously before rejecting or adopting them.
