# About Swedish Subsidiarity

**Swedish Subsidiarity** (Svensk Subsidiaritet) is an independent research and policy initiative examining how centralization creates vulnerability in Swedish society—and what the alternatives might be.

## Background

My name is Björn Kenneth Holmström. This project grew out of an analysis of global systemic risks that led to a simple conclusion: complex problems cannot be solved with centralized governance. Intelligence must be distributed.

Sweden has built remarkably efficient centralized systems. But efficiency and resilience are not the same thing—and it is resilience we are lacking.

## What I Do

* **Analyze** structural vulnerabilities in critical systems (food, healthcare, energy, preparedness)
* **Design** concrete proposals for distributed governance—what I call *local governance* (närstyre)
* **Develop** digital tools that can make subsidiarity practically possible

This also forms the foundation for **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)**, a broader framework with Sweden as its first application.

## An Honest Disclaimer

This is a one-man initiative using AI as a working tool. I have no organization behind me, no party support, no funding. What I do have is systems thinking, a technical background, and a conviction that someone needs to ask these questions—even if the answers take time.

## Contribute

I am not looking for followers, but competence. If you are a developer (Rust/Svelte), a farmer, healthcare professional, or simply have relevant experience—get in touch.
